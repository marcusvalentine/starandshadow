<p>On Chesil BeachDominic
Cooke (UK 2017) Billie Howie; Soairse Ronan</p>
<p>Script: Ian McEwan</p>
<p>Viewed: Tyneside Cinema 29 May 2018; ticket £9.75</p>

<p>Let them wear the hats</p>

<p>Chesil Beach is a 18 mile shingle strand connecting the Isle
ofPortland to the Dorset mainland.It is very particular place with a
characteristic geomorphology that has both psychic and a mythic resonance.</p>

<p>Sometimes the opening shot or montage at the start of a
movie defines something about either the film’s purpose or its ambition.The
opening shot of Cooke’s On Chesil Beach (co-produced by BBC Films, more of this
later) , is a medium wide shot of a beach, followed by some half a dozen shots
of waves breaking and various angle shots of the sea shore.Establishment shots that establish nothing.Shots that could be shots of any beach anywhere.
Stock shots. And by the end of the film
we understand that these shots presage a film that has little ambition and no
originality, that is happy to employ a tired format that re-enacts a series of cameo sequences that have been seen many times
before. Cooke’s movie would have more
appropriately titled: ‘Stock Shot Beach'.</p>

<p>John Osborne was a playwright and screen writer who has cast
a long shadow over the scripting of British films.His acerbic representation of class in his
1956 play Look Back in Anger (later filmed in 1959 by Tony Richardson), still
provides the average Brit film maker with a default position on interclass male
/female relationships. </p>

<p>Film scripts like McEwan’s Chesil Beach are play outs of the
same stereotypical individuals and situations that characterise Osborne’s writing.
McEwan’s script replicates Osborne’s bitter perception of upper middle class characters with their sense
of superiority and their contempt for the lower orders.In Anger as in Chesil Beach these combine to
make the women (often known as: ‘Mummy’)unavoidably (if sometimes apologetically)
snobbish; and the men (often known as: Daddy)
aggressively assertive of the prerogatives of their status.</p>

<p>The situation in Chesil Beach, as in Osborne’s drama, is of
a young male from a lower social order getting off with a female scion of a
better class of person. The device of class
tension with its stock characterisation is what Cooke’s Chesil Beach offers up
to the audience by way of the context to the playing out of the script.</p>

<p>Other than this it is difficult to see what Cooke’s Chesil
Beach is about other than where it is coming from:it is something from the BBC (dominant
co-producers) drama department.We are
told, through a caption, that it is: 1962.This has one meaning: Cozzies and Sets. Proper dresses, ties and period
cars that tell that this is a BBC production, and the BBC do ‘period’. </p>

<p>‘Period’!For all the
difference it makes Chesil Beach might be set in the ‘1930’s’.Although Chesil Beach is tricked out with
scripted referencing to ‘jazz’, CND and the Berlin Wall, these are surface
reflections thatplay no part in the fabric
of the film. J.P. Hartley’s catch
phrase in the Go Between that, ‘ …the past is another country…’, has been taken
to heart by BBC producers to mean a sort of licensed inconsequentiality. Find a
pretty boy find a pretty girl, wrap them in fixtures and fittings then let them
find their way towards sex.As long as
it’s a sentimental journey, the audience will buy the ticket. McEwan and Cooke
are on message. On payroll.</p>

<p>In short Chesil Beach has both the form and the content of a
cynically manufactured product.It is designed
to tick the boxes of commissioning editors, and buyers of international film TV
and on-line rights.Intelligence and
thinking in the making of film. TV /online thinking, is purely along the lines
of exploitation.The audience are
conceived as passive receptacles rather than active engagers in the
material.As passive receptors, they are
screen fodder to be manipulated.</p>

<p>Annotating manipulation.Feminism, in its commercialised orientations, has become corrupted in
many ways, becoming part of the diktat relating to commercial expressive
narrative products.The scripts and scenarios flowing out of
Hollywood and Europe have adopted a women and children first type of moral
maxim in relation to female protagonists. This results in the scripting of childish
pusillanimous narrations in which the women characters ( as yet the producers
haven’t really come to terms with gender benders and migrated gender
protagonists, but they will) are carefully plotted to emerge from their ordeal odyssey
or quest as the winners in any given situation.Sometimes, as winners will know, winning has costs, but this idea seems
to be lost on most contemporary film makers working for the multiplex or TV
ticket.In the bad old days of TV and
film Westerns the bad guys wore black hats and the good guys wore white hats,
just in case the audience didn’t get the plot.Today with the predictability of sexist moral stereotyping, the women
might as well don the white chapeaux.</p>

<p>On Chesil Beech is dire in this respect.Florence is a saint.A woman who exudes love and whose warmth
charms all those with whom she comes into contact. She is just a little
uncertain about penetrative sex. (But otherwise in the script she seems happy
with physicality). Edward on the other
hand, is not a bad guy though the scripts adumbrates an underlying violence in
his nature; and in relation to the crassly shot wedding night sexual tryst, Ed
is scripted all the bum notes, of course.And Ed’s behaviour makes him the transgressor whose actions, it is
suggested, are punished for the rest of his life.Florence of course does very well and,
without Ed, has a dazzlingly successful career in classical music. </p>

<p>It all ends in tears at the Wigmore Hall.But this pay off is like the junk food eaten
at the movies: designed to sate the emotional appetite for as long as it takes
the audience to leave the cinema or go and fix themselves a drink.</p>
