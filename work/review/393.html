<p>The CrowdKing Vidor
(USA 1928)Eleanor Boardman James Murray</p>
<p>Viewed: Star and Shadow Cinema 22 march 2015;Ticket £6</p>

<p>Retro-crit: We see
what he does not see…</p>

<p>Almost right from the start of the Crowd, Crowd King Vidor
puts his audience on notice that they are viewing a film that is a critique of
American ideology.And the manner in
which this critique will be effected is through the interplay ofa routine but brilliantly executed melodrama which
Vidor juxtaposes with images that undercut and undermine the belief systems
endemic to the plot.These images reveal
the macrocosmthe real context against
which the family, the microcosmhas to
play out its hopes.The lay bare the
reality that for most people the idea of success, of beingable to emerge out the crowd, is an
illusion.Vidor may have been
influenced by Metropolis, Lang’s futurist parable where the world is divided
between worker slaves and masters, with no social mobility. </p>

<p>The early shot in the film that caught my attention came in
the second sequence of the movie.In the
first we see John Sims our protagonist being born and his father declaring, in
the ripe cliché of the ‘American Dream’ a great future for the boy.We cut to John Sims about 10 years later,
finding him on a bench with his gang of kids, who are talking talking about
what they want to be when they grow up.</p>

<p>As the camera pans across the bench we see the kid at the end
is black.This is surprising in a
feature film of this era.In the clothes
he wears the black boy is in no way differentiated from the other kids, he just
seems part of the gang. But he takes no part in this talk.His future is written in the colour of his
skin.The camera pans back along the
line to John and the intertitle card reads that John is telling the gang that
his dad has said he is going become ‘somebody’in the world, perhaps President.The formulaic belief has passed down the
generation.For the black boy there is
nothing to discuss, no illusion, only the reality of race.But will John Sims realise the dream?</p>

<p>Cut to New York City, the crucible of individualistic
hope.Vidor follows John through work
and home, marriage and children, using
the building blocks of melodramatic form to create a characteristic life for
him and his wife.We see the emotional
relationship between them which is brilliantly executed and the cramped homes where
they live with their children. The
consistent vein of belief that sustains the family is the idea that the
American way will ultimately reward John with success for his hard work and
ability.</p>

<p>Vidor’s use of moral imagery transposes the viewer outside
of the binding clinch of melodrama. It enables the audience to see what John
himself cannot see: that his hopes are vain and illusionary. He is the subject
of a con game.He hasn’t really got a
chance, only crooks and the amoral get out of the ‘crowd’.Everyday decency has no future, except as a
wage slave. </p>

<p>Actuality shots of New York Citybrilliantly evoke it as a thronged city,compressed masses of workers scrambling to
earn a buck.Vidor returns to actuality
sbots periodically through the film: Coney Island, hundreds of men in line
trying for work.But the film is mostly
memorable for the three amazing sequences employing huge expressionist sets
todepict the reality of John Sim’s
situation.It is a moot point that the
viewer sees what the sets represent, John does not, he is simply in the movie,
where King Vidor has placed him.</p>

<p>The sets represent the world of work, the hospital and the
entertainment industry.John’s Office, a vast space filled with
serried lines of clerks,stretches back
almost to infinity creating the sense that the individuals there are lost and
helpless.There is no way out of this world.The second set that takes the breath away is
the maternity ward where John visits Mary.The door to the ward opens up to John revealing a huge space filled with
beds of new mothers.The space is a huge
incubating factory for workers.How you
are born is how you will live.John’s
walk into the maternity ward is filmed as an extraordinary track in which the
space seems to expand out before him.These scenes certainly evoke Metropolis, but are stunningly executed and
contrived to respond to Vidor’s specific purpose: to express the America of his
day.</p>

<p>The third set that dominates the film doesn’t use a
specially built structure, but utilises an existing building, the huge auditorium
of a theatre,.Vidor treats the theatre as
a set in the same way as the hospital ward and the work place.It is the final shot of the Crowd.May John and their son are in the auditorium
of the theatre.John’s future is
uncertain, no job no prospects of realising the Dream, and at risk of losing
his wife.We see the little family
watching the clowns on stage.They are
framed as a tight compact group laughing enjoying themselves.The camera moves up away from them tracking
back away from them towards the stage, revealing the whole auditorium packed
with people watching the stage, all happy all enjoying themselves.The movement of the camera over and revealing
this huge crowd seems to continue an impossibly long time, revealing more and
more people, until eventually the picture fades and credits roll.</p>

<p>The end shot suggests that the future for the crowd is to be
entertained. Distraction is their fate.</p>
<p><span></span><span>The Crowd draws on Metropolis and
anticipates Chaplin’s Modern Times.And
with its vision of America Vidor presages the Great Depression.It is a remarkable film.The melodramatic scripting and the playing of
Eleanor Boardman and James Murray, are both superbly handled. Boardman's resilience
and naturalness ground the film in the everyday.  James Murray gives a performance which calls
up the idea of the Clown.Without ever
using exaggerated gesture, Murray in mien and movement at moments suggests both
Chaplin and Buster Keaton: the both archetypal victims of fate. </span></p>
