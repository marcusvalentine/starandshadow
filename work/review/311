<p>Once upon a time in AnatoliaNuri Ceylan (2011 Turkey)Muhammet Uzunur; Yilmaz Erdogan; Taner Birsel; Firat Tanis</p>
<p>Viewed Tyneside Cinema 27 March 2012Ticket: £6.95</p>

<p>The Lady with the Lamp </p>

<p>In the opening lengthy post title shot (there is a pre-title
twilight shot that I didn’t understand) we see, in long shot, three cars
snaking through the night along the winding roads across the hilly mountainous
Anatolian terrain. Outlined in the thin beams of their headlights, the small
cars move slowly forward.This
shot is the first of the night sequences of the film and it is this long
opening nocturnal section that defines NC’sintention in realising his script.</p>

<p>This part of the film is a long endless spiralling into and
through night as space and night as time. The men, the public prosecutor, the
policeman and forensic doctor accompany two suspected murderers who have said
they will reveal the whereabouts of the body of the man they have killed.The immense darkness of the storm
blasted country swallows everything. The blind lead the blind in a quest of
futility.They are lost in the
space.They are lost in time.The men, characterised by an everyday
physical awkwardness are all claimed by forces from other places other
times.Unending internal
dialogues.A parallel metaphysical
journey lays claim to their psyches, engendering states of mind that abstract
them from the present.There is
darkness in the soul. </p>

<p>This is a culture where, outside of the very large cities,
women are absent from the public domain.And each of the significant male officials in the car,
is accompanied by an absent woman.Afemale shadow being whose
absence haunts and overwhelms.The
film is characterised by what is not present to the senses.This metaphysical proposition is made
real, given body in the pivotal sequence of NC’s film.During the visit to a village where the
party is dined by the mayor there is a power cut.The mayor orders his youngest daughter to bring an oil lamp
and serve tea.As the girl stands
before the men and hands to each their glass of tea, they look up into her face
which appears like a revelation of a Platonic form: the actualisation ofthe feminine.The appearance of her visage is a psychic force that
transforms. (Like the image of Florence Nightingale with her lamp in the wards
of Soutari - was this NC’s starting point?)After the scene with the lady with the lamp the psychic
darkness momentarily disperses. Night becomes day.The body is found.But the fleeting apparition cannot heal the mental wounds of phantom
women moving through the disturbed consciousness of the men.They continue trapped in double lives
in which outer symbolism of gesture and inner thought process become ever more
detached.No one is ever where they
seem to be. The men are all some place else.</p>

<p>Nuri Ceylan’s (NC) Once upon a time in Anatolia (OTA) called
to mind the recent output of films from Romania, in particular Porumboui’s
movies.The characteristic feature
that OTA shares with Cristiu Porumboiu’sPolice, Adjective is a clear sense of purpose and a sure grasp of the
filmic means employed to achieve intended goals. And their intended goals are
not embedded in simple narrative deployment;but aremetaphysical journeysinto
and through cultural darkness.Both NC and Porumboiu foster states of mind in which fleetingly intense
moments of clarity are attained.Porumboiu is politically attuned (though the scenes of the cop with his
wife have an intense symbolic personal resonance); NC in OTA attunes to social
and personal dimensions of his characters.An awareness ofthe defining features of Turkish social life, as the country in its
crazy unplanned way lurches towards Westernisation as a subjectivity.</p>

<p>NC’s title points up the irony he sees within modern story
telling.In traditional fairy
tales giants beasts and fabulous creatures roamed the land as externalised
phantasms that enabled man to gauge his own measure. Today monsters and the
fears they engender, are internalised taking on their formswithin our minds.Once in residence they become states of
being forces that slowly inexorably consume us from within. </p>

<p>States of mindmay be the concern of OTA but the base upon which NC interweaves the
actions and thoughts ofhis
protagonists, is a slate of dark black humour.The dark humour is the medium that links the
internalised reverberating internal dialogues of the men to the external
business of driving through the Anatolian night, digging the earth, exhuming
and dissecting corpses.It is a
humour of that insinuates itself into the gap between the actual and the
mental, the logical consequence of disassociation of mind and body. </p>

<p>The other linking between current Romanian films and NC is
the way in which are actors are used. Contemporary Iranian filmsalso share this quality of acting.The outwardly exaggerated expressive
use of face and body to create a gestural syntax of emotion using mouth teeth
eyes and eyebrows,characterises
most Western films.Most of the
acting is done to fill out roles, and it is if the actors trapped in their
roles are required to indulge in a sort of desperate signage of appropriate
approved response.In OTA
there is a trusting of the actors, and by extension, a trusting by NC ofthe audience, that through the
direction, through the scenario, through the dialogueeverything that needs to be stated about their
characters will become evident.The powerful emotions are the more powerful for being understated, with
the control of feelings being expressively more powerful than their
exhibition.In the West with the
circuitry of amplification that drives feedback loops between expressive modes
in soap opera drama and real life, the outcome is that expression is cheapened,
subject to fabrication and manipulation. To this extent NC and the other film
makers from this region are giving their Western audience a chance to
understand and reclaim dignity of feeling. </p>

<p>Lo! in that house of misery</p>
<p>A lady with a lamp I see</p>
<p>Pass through the glimmering gloom,</p>
<p>And flit from room to room.</p>
