<p>La Grande IllusionJean Renoir (Fr 1937) Jean Gabin, Erich von Stroheim</p>
<p>Viewed Star and Shadow Cinema 13 July 2014;Ticket £5</p>

<p>Here comes a candle to light you to bed…</p>

<p>The most telling psychic feature of Renoir’s movie is that
it leaves the viewer with a feeling of hope.And hope is a state of mind in relatively short supply in ‘war’ movies.We leave the cinema after many of these types
of films with images of shattered cities, broken bodies and smashed minds. And
not much else. La Grande Illusion is of course a film from another era, but it
is set in a Europe experiencing death and destruction on an industrial scale
and made at a time, 1937, when Europe was again marching towards a blind date
with self destruction.The basis of the
film’s hope lies in the affirmation by Renoir of the human spirit as a source
of strength.</p>

<p>A Wikipedia entry informs that the title of the film was
suggested to Renoir by a book of the same title, which proposed that WAR was
itself was the great illusion as it changes nothing.But on seeing the film I felt that in relation
to the content of La Grande Illusion, this is ultimately too abstract an
explanation to justify its content.</p>
<p>It seems to me that this title points to some vital element
in men’s nature that enables them to survive the most extreme experiences. </p>
<p></p>
<p>In La Grande Illusion, in spite of the desperate conditions
in which the characters find themselves,
it is their illusions that define them as human and that are a key resource helping them to survive.Those elaborate and sometimes deliberate
mental devices intentionally erected to separate and protect ourselves from the
raw brutality of existence.Illusions
can impede and even destroy us; but they can also give us strength in our
relations with actual life. Renoir looks
at both sides of the scales.</p>

<p>References to illusions occur a number of times in the film,
most notably ina throw away remark by
an unaccredited soldier, that the war will end soon.In
this soldier’s line, the relationship of the propaganda of ‘coming peace’ to
the actuality of present war, is seen by the speaker as such an illusion that
it’s a joke. But this need tojoke is
also an imperative.An impulse to affirm
that in fact it is still possible to imagine something else other than a ‘continual’
state of war.The Orwellian state of ‘perpetual
war’ envisaged in 1984 between <span>Oceania,
Eurasia, and Eastasia brooks no possibility
of peace even as a joke.Perpetual War
is beyond a joke, but it is a state which has found itself echoed in the
Bush/Blair doctrine of the War on Terror.Perpetual War is the situation that haunts 21st century life,
to the extent that today we can barely even joke about the illusion of peace.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Illusions
as collective indulgences run through La Grande Illusion. They are voluntarily
contracted and dissolved as soon as their purpose is served. The prisoners imagine
in great detail, eating a multicourse meal in a grand restaurant .The descriptions of each individual course
sustains momentarily the illusion of actual food.Likewise the arrival of a basket women’s
garments for dressing up unleashes a collective object fetishism in which the
items can replace the actual absence of women.Renoir sketches out the scene sufficiently for it to be clear that sex
can be an ambiguous assignment, and that clothes, as outer makers of the gender
boundary can in themselves sustain the illusion of the feminine.Illusion creates the a brief triumph of
imagination over reality. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Illusion
is quite different from lies.The German
farmer doesn’t accept the lie, the attempt by the German military to foist on
the people the illusion that the battle of Verdun which cost the lives of all
her menfolk, was a glorious victory.Lies simply weaken the spirit. But the illusions, fostered as a
temporary collective belief strengthen spirit.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Our
illusions define us.Renoir also suggests that songs and ritual
also contribute to a significant degree to the nature of our being in the
world. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span></span>Songs run through La Grande Illusion
like invisible thread holding both men and the film together.The people sing for the sense of vitality
that it lends to being. It is perhaps illusionary but it brings dimensions of
power and control into life. The power of the voice to affirm something.In La
Grande Illusion song expresses different feelings.When the French POW’s break into the La
Marseillaise on the news of the French recapture of a small fort in Flanders,
they affirm their Frenchness as a type of challenge.As the German soldiers pile out of the hall
to escape the song, that moment releases the men from the oppression of their imprisonment.The singing is a ‘freeing from’ the actual and
it is this quality of song, that Renoir characterises as most life endorsing. Again by way of contrast in ‘1984’ there are
no songs. Big Brother’s regime has colonised the collective conscience.Big Brother recognising the potency of voice
to inspire collective resistance, has banished songs as ‘thoughtcrime’.Songs have been driven to the outer reaches
of the psyche where George and Julia struggle as amnesiacs to reassemble the
words of the nursery rhythm ‘Oranges and Lemons’.Today it seems song has lost its power to
call upcollective intentionality.Now in
Britain we have no visions sustainable through the voice and our music is
reduced to a subjectivity.We are the
poorer for it.Big Brother would
approve.</p>

<p>The structure of La
Grande Illusion is shaped by the ritual.Each phase of the film is defined through ritual: the rituals of escape,
of caste, of performance, of Christmas and Birthday.Of
course the organisation of attempts to escape by POW’s have a ritualistic
nature and to some extent an illusionary quality as there is no escape from the
war.But escape also has a symbolic
quality and is motivated by a complex of inner drives.</p>

<p>Central to La Grande Illusion are the rituals of class and
caste as exemplified by the German Officer von Raufenstein.The ceremonial aspect of the military comprises
von Raufenstein’s world, and to a lesser extent that of Boeldieu. The
ritualised nature of their exchanges marks them as beings from another era,
engaging in a stylised form of communication that is alien to the world in
which they live and fight. Von
Rauffenstein in particular is so implicitly grounded in vanishing conventions
of the Junkers, that he is unable even see the actual situation that confronts
him in the castle. Boeldieu in contrast
connects with the actual, ultimately by dyeing.But although the illusions supported by
ritual exert negative control over Von Rauffenstein and and to a lesser extent
Boeldieu, other rituals presented by Renoir are much more positive.They temporarily fold over individuals
protecting and invigorating them, making them stronger.The rituals of the shows mounted by the
prisoners, the sharing of food, the ritual of Christmas, all are marked by
Renoir as key moments of development.In time of hardship deprivation and duress ritual protects what is best
in human kind.</p>

<p>Renoir is a director in the classical mould. He brings to
film an absolute clarity in the perspective and quality of his shots and an
unsurpassed understanding of way in which he wants to construct his movie out
of shots.</p>

<p>The camera sustains its privileged perspective, it doesn’t
hop around different points of view.The
viewer always knows what they ar seeing, as Renoir brings into central frame
the object of interest and holds it until its natural tension can be no longer
contained and the shot ends.Each shot
builds up its own momentum driving the film, as a series of mechanised springs
towards its resolution in the snow of Switzerland.As a director understanding the inner logic
of shot vectors and tension, Renoir has few rivals in Classical Cinema. </p>
