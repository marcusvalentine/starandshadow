<p>A deadness of being</p>

<p>Hollywood doesn’t do certain subjects very well: sex, mental
illness and spirituality.Sex is handled
as pornography image and status; mental illness as overcoming and spirituality
as outward acting facial gestures and gloopy text and music.</p>

<p>Silence has at its core an idea of the religious spirit as conveyed
through the persona of Garrpe and Rodrigues, two missionary Jesuits.But Scorsese’s
Silence never develops any spiritual key, and is unable to move beyond
spectacle.It presents as a sort of
Japanese Spartacus or Quo Vadis, with about the same claim to spiritual insight
as these classic epics.</p>

<p>This outcome may have something to do with the way in which
Hollywood movies are put together as productions.After the purchase of a property, there is
the script development sometimes proceeding alongside putting talent in
place.The script development is the key
stage in getting the project to production and a Hollywood script, given the
green light, normally has certain key characteristics:strong characters who have potential to grow
into the narrative; good plotting with a realisable through story which the
viewers can understand and a stylistic gloss packaging up films for specific
genres or audiences –family – horror – male
youth etc. which stylistic gloss also determines the music input and tracks.</p>

<p>This is the tried and road tested Hollywood production
schema.Subject matter is usually less
important than character or through story, though content is important for sell
pitch and trail. The problem for Scorsese
when he tries to work a spiritual
dimension into his story, is firstly that there is no place for the spiritual
outside the resources of his actors. And secondly that the domain of the spirit
is usually dysfunctionally served by scripts, either as voice overs, texts or lines of dialogue.Directors who have managed to insinuate faith
and spirit into film are few: Dreyer, Bergman, Tarkovsky, Bresson there are a
others, but all these aforementioned directors carry spirit into the grain of
the medium of film and the image.Dialogue is often sparse; characters, and the relations of the characters
are revealed by the mis–en-scene.They
are for seeing, for the audience to see.The dynamics are to include the viewer by enabling seeing; not being told or manipuated as per text in a
script.</p>

<p>The aforementioned directors rarely resort to voice over to
tell the audience their characters state of mind or struggles.The use of voice over in Silence is a crass,
crude device that destroys itself in utterance.Instead of playing out ‘Silence’ through his characters, Scorsese plays out
through the script.Instead of acting presences, the people on the screen filling
out the scenario (and directors in the past have often, but not always,
resorted to amateur players),Scorsese
employs two cute dudes, pretending to be Jesuit priests.At certain VO places in the script, where
Rodrigues has ‘ internal moments’,such
as doubting the existence of God or the reason for suffering, Scorsese resorts
to close up affect images of Rodrigues.The effect is that it looks like some one is reading out the VO script
while Scorsese gives direction to Andrew Garfield tolook
spiritual. This is according to the soap opera guide to the art of coarse
acting. </p>

<p>The scene that is most indicative of Scorsese’s inability to
be anything other than a crude action movie director is the long sequence where
the four Japanese Christians are crucified in the ocean.The camera keeps cutting back to Rodrigues
and Garrpe as they spectate from behind some convenient bushes ( ridiculous
conceit of a shot ).Although they
mutter on about suffering the two priests are absurdly suggestive of a couple
of school kids playing hooky who have crept in behind the bleachers to see the
game.</p>

<p>The sea crucifixion scene, as a prolonged sequence, is
unnecessary ( I mean we’ve seen or can see, if we so chose, Isis obscenity) and
shows that Scorsese is really only interested in spectacle; adding the two
priests into the sequence, relinquishes any claim by ‘Silence’ to be being
taken seriously. And the rest of ‘Silence’ adds nothing more to this contiguity
of physical abuse and over voiced anguish that characterise the sea crucifixions.The debates between Rodrigues and the
Inquisitor are comic book bubble speech dialogues, and the meeting between
Ferrara and Rodrigues seems like two old actors getting together. Brando or Max
von Sydow might have given something to the Ferrara character.</p>

<p>Scorcese signs off ‘Silence, with a typical Hollywood
manipulation.The final shot is the
consummation of the through story: thezoom into the crucifix in Rodrigues’ palm. But this shot has been set up by the
manipulation of the point in time at which Rodrigues’ Voice Over dries up.Having been drip fed Rodrigues’ internal
state of mind for the first part of the movie, his inner voice dries up at the
point at which the audience might like to know if he had actually become apostate
or whether his outer actions concealed an inner deep resistance.Anyway this manipulation at least gives the
script writer or Scorsese the satisfying feeling that he has given his audience
a spectacular surprise send off with the lastshot.</p>
