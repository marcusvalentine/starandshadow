<p>American HoneyAndrea
Arnold (UK 2016)Sasha Lane, Riley
Keough</p>
<p>viewed Empire Cinema Newcastle, 25 Oct 2016; ticket: £3.75</p>

<p>no opposition</p>

<p>Easy Rider was the first contemporary road movie I saw and I
thought it was brilliant.It presented
an America that was in a process of transformation; an America that was dark;
an America that was being forged out of new socio economic relations; an
America that could never return to the static 1950’s; an America investing in
new restless consumption patterns.Driven by music that espoused a lyrical
anarchism, Easy Rider took the viewer on a trip into an unfolding land where
death and life were espoused in an eternal illusionary present of now.</p>

<p>Fuelled by sex and drugs Dennis Hopper’s 1969 movie
foregrounded a country mired in the homicidal
obscenity of Vietnam, where Nixon was the newly elected President.Politics of course didn’t play out in the
movie, but Easy Rider felt like a response to the established order, a burst of
automatic fire from a generation that was going to change America. Change not
in any way necessarily for the better;but evenso, of necessity, change.</p>

<p>Easy Rider cruised through the projector gate in an easy 90
or so minutes.Easy Rider was of course
a movie dominated by men.It was a man’s
perspective, a man’s story, told from the back of the hog.The women were for leisure when the guys stepped
off their bikes. </p>

<p>2016 sees Andrea Arnold’s American Honey.Fifty years later and a road movie shot from
a woman director’s perspective with a female protagonist (Star). It’s another world: one that takes 163 minutes
to view.</p>

<p>No where to nowhere.Star leaves a space which looks a little like the kind of nowhere
depicted by Kimberley Pierce’s Boys Don’t Cry.A land of the forgotten, the subculture of bluecollar leisure.Trumpland almost certainly, a collection of
clapboard homes close by the highway stop with a bar and motel.Star leaves this behind, in the best American
tradition, to get on the bus.Whereas
Kesey’s bus was going somewhere if only on a mashed up journey to travel to the
limits of hallucinogenic experience, this bus goes nowhere, its destination is
money making for Crystal, gang mistress who runs the show.</p>

<p>Arnold’s bus seems a little retro.Even with the hard edge soundtrack the bus
seems caught in a 90’s bubble, with none of the kids on board (everyone is
college age) being caught up in iPhone babble stream.The which today seems unlikely.Recruited onto the bus to be part of an fake
student itinerant magazine selling racket, the kids party hard on and off the
road. Butpartying is little more than
high school jinx and capers.And American Honey is a lot tamer than many
other American films featuring teenagers let loose on the world: the kids like alcohol (lots) tattoos drugs (lots)
hard music hard cocks and plenty of sex.The point about the sex is that it is about status rather than
sensuality or emotion, though in the American Honey script, Star is a little
confused about this. </p>

<p>American Honey lacks oppositions.Or the oppositions in Arnold’s script are
left hanging without development.Nothing
really happens, except that Star gets a little wiser about life as she
understands that Jake fucks just to notch up conquests. In this respect there are two mildly graphic
sex scenes which though quite noisy are planted just to make this point. Star
takes risks in going off alone with men, but nothing of consequence happens; she sells magazines using her innocent kid sex
appeal rather than the brutality of deceptive blackmail employed by Jake.The bus is a peculiar world where nothing
happens that means anything. Perhaps a little like the world of America. </p>

<p>And yet there were elements, oppositional elements that
Arnold worked into the bus trip scripting that were surprising and powerful but
never allowed developmental weight.Most
strongly there is Arnold’s fascination with the power of fire and fireworks –
explosive devices – that flicker to life in the movie, that are graphically suggestive of
another agitated reality pushing up under the surface of life on the bus.There are three sequences where the bus kids
coalesce as a group into playing out primitive deranged fire rituals.These moments impress as a sort a revisioning
of Lord of the Flies, an archaic priapic energy takes over the group: against
the fire the young kid powerfully swings his cock opening up the doors of a suppressed
and denied vitality in life.But the
potential and power of these sections never links into the thematic body of the
film.They remain bracketed off from the
body of the movie, lost off as curiosities. </p>

<p>I felt this raw primitivism should have been the force
shaping Arnold’s film.Instead of a
communal energy forging content, it is Star’s individual perception around
which the material is moulded; and her character struggles to carry the film
which after two hours is already overlong.Her default close up mode, of which there are many is a sort ofpretty half smile, a mode which quickly
becomes tiresome.She skirts the embrace
of the group, gets taken by Jake and does a lot of observing. In particular
retreating into her own world of insect vision, where Arnold’s camera lingers
over various insect shots, the presumed point of view of Star.But these shots although announcing themselves
as having some kind of importance are curiously removed from Star’s being.As is the last shot, in which Star wades thigh deep
into the waters of a lake.So Arnold
ends her film with a primeval ur-gesture from her protagonist.Star’s watery embrace of the natural world, a
gesture of immersion into another reality, but by the end of the film, too late
to be connected to what has gone before. </p>

<p>American Honey communicates as a anodyne experience.Without oppositions it drifts
inconsequentially from one event to another, one situation to another, evincing
a feeling that Arnold either has no control over what she is doing or that she
is uncomfortable with developing the logic of the forces she sets in play;
rather she sets out to compromise them.  Arnold's hand held camera,  communicates a consuming agitation a mood of restlessness. But without content to match the shaky image, the camera work simply looks like a device for making the film easy to cut.</p><p><span>It is possible that some contemporary women
filmmakers feel constrained to work under an implicit ideological subtext of
feminism.Feminism in this sense is a
sort of fuzzy ideological nexus of ideas that embraces propositions such as the
equality of genders, the endorsement of women’s power and a demand for respect
for women.The problem is that film
makingthat is ideologically driven is
usually uninteresting and dull, in that nothing develops fully unless through
ideologically appropriate means and ends.The danger of implicit ideologies in relation to creative work is that
they engender (sic) an almost unconscious self censorship, so that certain
thoughts,certain ideas are either not persued
or if developed are appropriately constrained to conform in alignment with an ideological
coherence. Film becomes a dynamic of justifiable logic
rather than of truth content as the logic of ideologies frees the film maker
from the messiness of life. </span></p>
<p><span>For women directors today as for directors in
the Soviet Union the issue is that their work is vulnerable to being affected
by their own internally driven censorship mechanisms, so that certain types of
ideas or propositions that may be an inherent part of their material, are
denied or glossed over.I don’t know if
Andrea Arnold’s work is built on a feminist substrate, but the hesitant and
unconvincing nature of American Honey, felt as if she was working with an
existential Other informing her perception.</span></p>
