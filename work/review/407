<p>MacbethJustin
Kurzel (UK 2015) Michael Fassbender, Marion Cotillard</p>
<p>viewed: Empire Cinema Newcastle 6 Oct 2015; ticket: £3.75</p>

<p>Bewhiskered!</p>

<p>I thought this offering of Macbeth by Kurzel was closer to
Mad Max Fury Road than to Polanski’s or Wells’ versions of the bard’s Scottish
play.That is to say the film was a very
contemporary offering, a take on the tragedy in which the tensions and psychic contradictions
of the text were of secondary order to the immersive quality of the experience.
</p>

<p>This Macbeth owes more to contemporary forms, video game and
the art installation, than it does to the textual theatrics of Shakespeare’s
drama.As movie, the question is not the
integrity of the production to its theatre provenance but whether the material
can be structured and moulded to the new forms of distraction.The nature of the multiplex audiences
inclines them to demand something in the presentation of material that meets
their visual expectations, approximates to the nature of other kinds of media
to which they are habitually exposed.</p>

<p>So this Macbeth doesn’t take us into meaning but into
experience. And in this experience Shakespeare’s
writing ceases to exist as series of psychic signs and symbols; it operates
more simply as a pointer to the state of the game, the action and psychological
states that are in play.The text is
subsumed in the sound track and image. One key element of video gaming that is
replicated is the continuous stream of sound, mostly percussion driven.In this Macbeth the music has a direct physiological
quality, an elemental somatic effect on perception, bonding eye and ear to the
affective material on screen: locating the viewer in-screen.The effects tracks likewise highlight the
body: the foley effect of the sound of Duncan’s ribs cracking open as Macbath
plunges his dagger into his heart.</p>

<p>The control element of game consuls cannot be duplicated
with current technology, but the use of heavily edited big close ups is a
partial simulation of the game idea, which together with the music, fuses the
audience with the characters.</p>

<p>The two main characters in the kind of movie Kurzel is
making,Macbeth, Lady Macbeth,
don’twork through identification in the
classic movie association, rather they work as sort of avatars.They don’t actually represent us, but the
experience is mediated through them.In
relation to the idea of filming Shakespeare, this is advantageous.Olivier in his time on the back of post war elation
could work Henry V,as an interpretation
of nationalistic identification.But
often Shakespeare translated on screen, with honourable exceptions such as
Kurosawa’s Ran, hits the twin buffers of difficult language and characters with
whom it is hard to identify.Medium
shots, long shots lay bear the naked difficulty of Elizabethan language.Kurzel castes us right into Macbeth’s
whiskers, into the follicles, overwhelming the meter of soliloquy and dialogue
with the physicality of his being.Where
there are medium shots often there is an overwhelming sense of body in play. Most
obviously in the scene, mostly one long duration shot, where Lady Macbeth
persuades her husband into betrayal and murder.But it is the subtext,to coin a phrase, that arrests the attention.As this key dialogue takes place, Lady Macbth
explores its tantric possibilities, opening her legs and tilting towards her
husband who fucks her as she corrupts him.The words slip away from the attention of the audience, as they do from
Macbeth, who in the time honoured tradition, simply says “Yes dear!”</p>

<p>Landscapes are much abused in current cinematological use.Gratuitously often </p>
<p>out played, durationally over long and often trying to suggest states of mind.Kernel uses them to effect here.The scape shots appear like a installation, a
walk through experience which leads into a situation.The panoramic shots in Macbeth work with
dramatic effect to set up the situation, so that in a film that is dominated by
close shots, we can see where we are, we understand the location is a vastness.</p>

<p>If in form and style Macbeth pitches into a quasi world of
game like experience, Kurzel understands that the three weird sisters cannot be
part of this world.In renderings both
theatric and filmic that I have seen of Macbeth, the witches come from an ‘other’
world.In this movie,the ‘other’ world, the larger than life game
dimenrsion, is already occupied. Kurzel draws his ‘witch’ women from the realm
of the ordinary.Their appearance and
presence, (usually long or medium shot, is as simple cottars: in fact women
come off the local Highland Council estate.What is important is that they stand in a separate location to the
kingdom of Macbeth, that they occupy a different reality.This
is their purpose, and with effect Kurzel has understood this.</p>
