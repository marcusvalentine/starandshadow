<p>Seven PsychopathsMartinMcDonagh ( 2012 UK)Colin
Farell Woody HarrelsonSamRockwell.</p>

<p>Viewed Tyneside Cinema 10 Dec 2012; ticket £7</p>Stoney heart&hellip; 


<p>On 11 June 1963 Thich Quang Duc a Vietnamese Bhuddist Monk
immolated himself in Saigon at the crossroads in front of the Cambodian
Embassy.The act of self
immolation was Duc’s (supported by his fellow monks and nuns) ultimate protest
against the discrimination practiced by the Diem regime against Bhuddists.Diem himself,  a corrupt reliquary of French colonial rule, was a Catholic
and the regime used the Catholic religion as the touchstone of political
reliability; to advance under Diem’s administration you had to be Catholic,
although the South Vietnamese population was 90% Bhuddist despite a decade of
forced conversions.Diem was
progressively curtailing Bhuddist rights and expressions of their faith, and
Duc’s act of self immolation was a direct response to Diem’s ban on the flying
of traditional Bhuddist flags on the birthday of the Bhudda. Interestingly
Duc’s heart survived intact both his self immolation and his later cremation
which was viewed as an attestation of his sainthood. On the evidence of Seven
Psychopaths, Martin McDonagh’s heart, if he has one, will burn.</p>

<p>This historical digression is prompted by McDonagh’s movie
Seven Psychopaths (SP) that has as one of its core interwoven stories, the tale
of a ‘Bhuddist psychopath’.The
monk story psychology is somewhat convoluted and unconvincing, but its raison
d’etre is that a monk such as Duc, had he not immolated himself, might instead
have sought out his revenge on the USA for their war in Vietnam.The story is admittedly almost
deliberately confused.But
it is clear that the Bhuddist protests of this era that included acts of self
immolation, had nothing to do with protest against the USA;and that the Bhuddist ethos amongst the
monks and nuns of South Vietnam at this time, had no place for violence against
others.The moral bankruptcy
of both the film script and the director/writer Martin McDonagh (MM) is evidenced
in the manipulative distortion both of history and religion that MM has had to
recourse to, in order to give his film even the semblance of an ending.A cheap trick that allows the film to
go out with a ‘bang’ in one of its last sequences by exploiting the recreated
image of a burning monk. As if this act and its corresponding image had any
meaningful connection to the gash footage that had preceded it.A cheap trick.</p>

<p>The distorted history used as back story in SP is
exploitative demeaning junk in the worst Hollywood tradition. What else
remains?Certainly notthe cinematography which is
uninteresting and adds little to the film except to confirm its mediocracy.</p>

<p>The structure of the film is built on a sort of
deconstructed model that is broken down into compartmentalised narratives that
interlink with each other and with imaginary strands (most noticeably the
Vietnam psychopath story) .The
film’s structure is a knowing nod at post modernist and New Wave film
sensibility.But the
structurebuilt on the
intertweaved strands of dognappers, the travails of ascript writer and a criminal gang,lacks aunifying dynamic.SP is not
so much filled out with an idea but emptied outof ideas.Frantic chaotic desperate action replaces any semblance of a coherent
film or dramatic theme.Lacking a
material idea, the film is without energy; without energy there is no tension
in the interplay and interrelationship between its strands; without tension
there is no pace, only a confused melee of images. Without a structural
dynamic, SP overdepends on dialogue such as the ‘pitching sessions’ between
Marty and Tommy(?),Like the
movie, the dialogue comprises a series of little ideas that amount to nothing
much except the repeated arch suggestion of a story featuring the idea of a
Bhuddist psychopath (sic).</p>

<p>The film relies on one running gag, the dognapping idea,
which is the source of continuous referential humour; but the mawkish
repetition of the device released by the idea of the heavy criminal having a
big soft spot for his pooch soon ceases to be very funny.The film also relies on its
humorous dialogue which takes its cue from the sort of interchanges that
Tarantino perfected in his early films, interwoven with the sort of deadpan
‘silly’ writing Ricky Gervaise successfully built into ‘the Office’ series and
a little Iain Banks thrown in for the lurid detail. The only trouble with MM’S
writing is that it is laborious unfunny and patently derivative in the manner
sometimes heard in pubs where one member of a ‘crowd’ is entertaining his
mates.</p>

<p>The script development is so uneven that the characters can
be seen only as mechanical ciphers, spurious affect machines for MM’s vacuous
meanderings.</p>
<p><i>The number of films that are patched up with music! People flood a film with music. They are preventing us from seeing that there is nothing in those images.  (Robert Bresson - Notes on the Cinematographer)</i></p>
<p>The soundtrack of SP is filled out with a selection of eclectic
music.I sometimes wondered if
MM’s choice of music was intended to take my mind away from rather than draw me
into the film I was watching.After a quote from Book of Revelations, which opens the movie (again
Tarantino type quote/homage referencing the hitman in Pulp Fiction - which is
superbly structured) and a cute dialogue about Dillinger getting shot in the
eye, the film breaks into PP Arnold’s The First Cut is the Deepest.Like the rest of the music in SP the
song had no relation that I could fathom to anything that appeared on screen. I
supposed the song, like the others, was in the movie because MM liked it and more importantly it operated as a powerful distraction from what was on the screen. ( and it probably cost a lot of money).</p>

<p>On the evidence of SP, MM is running out of road and has no
where to go except Hollywood style distortion and manipulation of ideas. On the
Sunday evening I saw this heavily promoted film the cinema was almost empty and
what audience there was seemed unmoved by the spectacle before their eyes.</p>
