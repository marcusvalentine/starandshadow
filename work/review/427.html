<p>viewed Tyneside Cinema 28 June 2016; ticket £9.25</p>

<p>knock knock who’s
there…? someone missing…? </p>
<p>Lampedusa as filmed by Gianfranco Rosi is a visual paean to
oppositions: the empty /the full, the ordered/ the chaotic, the open/ the
closed, internal / the external, within time/without timeAnd more. </p>
<p>Oppositions organised in geographic proximity. Islanders and
refugees both sharing space on this small Mediterranean island.But now you see them now you don’t.On the
island we see the islanders but we don’t see the migrants, they are invisible, their
new European identities as the ‘unseen’ already anticipated. </p>
<p>On Lampedusa the streets are empty, the escapees confined to
their own enclaves.</p>
<p>The islanders lead out their traditional lives on Lampedusa,
life ordered by a natural unfolding of time that divides into past present
future.The refugees and migrants live
outside the order of time, compressed into a chaotic hallucinogenic now.</p>
<p> The islanders are rooted on rock and lapped by the sea. The
migrants travelling across water, crashing onto the rocks or scooped out of the
Mediterranean are alive if they are lucky, dead if they are not. They are trapped in endless motions in which
time has ceased to be a significant marker of life.For the migrants the imperative is ‘escape’
to not stop fleeing until they find something. When in due course, they leave Lampedusa they leave
no imprint on the island other than on the statistical compilations of NGOs.More than 400,000 thousand passed through, ghosts
rather than solid entities.</p>
<p> Without commentary and working though image simple, many of
Rosi’s shots comprise two great encompassers of Lampedusa:sea and sky.Images that Rossi exploits, but which conjure different associations for
the islanders and migrants. </p>
<p>The sea before and sky overhead stretch out around and over,
containing the sentience of all beings.For the islanders the surrounding waters are their environment, a living
testament to their collective history, the source of their food and
livelihood.For the arrivees, the
migrants the sea is experienced otherwise:as barrier ordeal and death.The
sky that hangs over Lampadusa hangs over all beings.For the islanders this sky with rolling
clouds signifies the here and now, the intensity of the present, it mediates
action, reflects back consciousness of life.For the arrivees it barely exists as a psychic immediacy.On Lampedusa the migrants are as if in a
state of trance they are trapped in their own internal landscapes. </p>
<p> An island boy whittles wood to make his catapult;a Nigerian recounts as a liturgy in
collective form the ordeal of his flight: “We crossed the dessert the dessert could not
stop us, we crossed the mountains the mountains could not stop us, we ran to
the sea, the sea could not stop us.”</p>
<p>The effect of his words echoes the power of the old
testament, the cry of a people lost in the wilderness, a people possessed by
the spirit.</p>
<p> Although the images are not juxtaposed in Rosi’s edit, I
somehow connected this liturgical listing of ordeals survived and overcome with
the long duration shot of the grandmother making up her bed.The order the certainty represented in this
act of meticulous physical geometry; the ecclesiastic lay out of her
bedroomwith its saints and sacred
objects.A feeling of deadness in this
bedroom, reflected and compounded in the images of dead migrants suffocated in
the steerage hold of their boat, lying in filth and squalor, perhaps many of
them without names.The dead are
everywhere.</p>
<p>I understand that Rosi wanted to make a pure film. In which
images manipulated and exploited would stand for any words that might or could
be said.But the human voice is part of
our world. Rosi’s Fire at Sea felt like a piece of filmic surgery, a clinicians
assemblage of images.As Rosi knocked on
the door of Lampedusa it seemed as if he was not there.He had absented himself. </p>
<p>And perhaps this is OK.No voice. Rosi in avoiding the
stories of refugees and migrants the staple of radio and TV, Rosi, abstracting
his material reaches out into the reality of the the void of refugees and
migrants.They are people stripped out
of time, stripped out of history, a group of people living in a timevoid. A void which groups like Isis seek, in their
own time to fill, by giving back to those lost in time the precious gift of
time. This is a film about the medium of
time.</p>
