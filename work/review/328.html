<p>Amour (Love)<span>Michael Haneka(Fr Ger
2012)J P Trentignant; Emmanuelle
Rive </span></p>
<p>Viewed Tyneside Cinema Newcastle, 16 Nov 2012; Ticket £7.00</p>

<p>Empty box blues.</p>

<p>Amour is a film narrative expressed in Michael Haneka’s
(MH) own scenario and enfolded in his particular directorial style&hellip;After viewing the film my reaction was
that the script for Amour is not in accord with hislanguage as a film maker.Consequently the film is like a Japanese gift: the
beautifully wrapped box that contains the gift is more singular than the
contents</p>

<p>Amour shot completely in colour by MH, is presented to the
audience wrapped a sepia hued patina that is redolently suggestive of the
richness of the earlier life of Anne and Georges.The shooting comprises two types of shots already
familiar from Hanika’s previous films: the long steadicam shots that follow
characters through the increasingly familiar layout of the living space; and
the formal two shot, set up as still life portraits.In Amour these two types of shots are interspersed
with close ups, that often cut to reverse shot, to carry dialogue.The dominant theme suggested by the
camera is that it represents that unseen presence,, the viewer’s gaze.We gaze from th outside upon the
performances of the actors.We
watch two actors at work evoking in their performing the processes of acute and
chronic illness, understood in the context of what is presented as their long
contented relationship. </p>

<p>Doors open and close, and feature in Amour as they do in
other MH films.For instance the
film opens with the couple’s apartment door smashed open by firemen.In Amour the function of the door and
its frame differs from his previous work.MH in his other movies uses the door motif to suggest something about
what it is possible to see.Doors
are shot half open, only partially disclosing the space people and events.This framing sets up the viewer to
engage with what is only partially revealed, to confront the world as a place
where the hidden and the seen are in constant interplay. In MH’s films the
audience is always outside, and challenged by MH to understand what is hidden
and why.In Amour, the
apartment’s huge French panelled doors with their impressive architraves are
certainly prominent, but they serve only to seal off the space.As the apartment becomes a world of the
dead, the door transposes into a gate, that is either open or closed,Beyond this there is nothing in the
portal itself to challenge comprehension of what is happening. A person is
dying a world is slipping away the door is closing.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It seems to me in MH’s films there are no internalities. MH
does not work with subjectivity in the grain of his films.We are presented with facts of the
matter; the actors play out the scenario which probes about the presented
situation.</p>

<p>In Amour neither the camera work, nor the structure of the
shots (what the camera allows us to see) nor editing, work to effect the
viewer’s passage into the states of mind of the protagonists.We see the situation.It is a film about a situation. We stay
on the outside of the situation; this is a film of exteriorities. As such Amour is a vehicle completely reliant of the expressive affect of its two protagonists,
Anne and George, which ultimately defines the movie as an art house soap opera,
worthy in its intent, barren in its execution.</p>

<p>The audience are cast as the watchers of the mechanics of
the script.The script itself
resembles a medico-sociological paper on status change in acute and chronic
illness.The script cranks through
the post stroke situations that sufferers and carers face: we see loss of
speech and diminution of mental faculties, loss of mobility, the need for help
in using the toilet, loss of bowel and bladder control, the bad nurse
experience, the need to be fed, the final stages of consciously and emotionally
experienced incapacitation. Each stage a little episode on the downward
inclining slipway that eventually leads to the logic of mutual death.All of this is no more than a log with
parellel emotive commentary. This emotive commentary, provided almost
exclusively in the affect images of the actor’s faces, leads to a limited
palette of the same expressive gesturing: suffering, stoicism, understanding.The longer the film continues the more
evident it becomes that we are watching two actors faking it. This feeling of
faking is particularly strong in the scene where Anne is killed by Georges. The
camera pans off the close shot of George and Anne (who’s asphyxiating under the
pillow that he holds down over her face) to Anne’s body which we see, for some
30 seconds or more, struggle and twitch as she dies.But we know no one is dieing.At this point Amour and MH lose all credibility in the
banality of the literalised faked film image.For MH to film the faked twitching ofEmmanuelle Rive is counterproductive
and pointless, an insult to the audience.Not disturbing or shocking only irrelevant bad film making.</p>

<p>As it progresses Amour becomes desperate in its expressive
devices.Towards the end of the
film there is a montage of the watercolour landscapes which han in theapartment.The apartment space is almost overflowing with matter
artefacts memorabilia of the past.MH is careful, except for a sketch of a bird in the bookcase at the
entrance of le salon, to exclude this material from the imagery of the film. We
are aware of it without being able to specify it. We know there are paintings
but they are lost in the background.Suddenly as Anne enters the portaql of her last act, there is a montage
of at least 6 paintings, all wistful landscapesThe effect of this montage is to understand it as a rather
heavy handed metaphor.Also intercut
into Amour are a dream sequence of Georges and a fantasy sequence where he
sees Anne after he had killed her. Both seem to belong to another film that was
not made. </p>

<p>The one sequence that points to a revealing of internality
comprises the scene between George and the pigeon that intrudes for a second
time into the apartment through the open window.The scene is allowed to end enigmatically, though it seems
likely that George having caught the bird, kills it, as a sort of emotional dry
run.The scene opens up
possibilities that are enigmatic dark and perhaps contradictory and which are
otherwise absent in Amour, and for this reason the scene also feels like it
belongs only tangentally to Haneka’s scenario</p>
