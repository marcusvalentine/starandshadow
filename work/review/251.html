<p><span>In the year 2009 we shall prepare for the end of times, the apocolypse, sometimes known as the rapture as written about thousands of years go by an ancient indio race known as the Mayans.This race faced its own demise at the hands of European invaders a few hundred years ago, an act we were all witness to the beginnings of in Mel Gibson’s almost documentary like piece, ‘Apocalypto’.</span></p>
<p><span>These end of times predictions have been accurately layed out in painstaking detail by the director </span><span>Roland Emmerich</span><span>, to prepare us for our future demise which begins at the home of our modern intellectual elites and soothsayers, Hollywood.This film is the warning so don’t say you weren’t warned and what year were we warned about, a warning we can no longer deny.The year is                                 ‘2012’</span></p>
<p><span>I will now review these predictions, as layed out by our intellectual masters, who sit in the Holly land, right beside the mystical land of Disney.Before I do though, purely for Debbie’s mum so she also can enjoy the insight of this review, I will not use any foul language and for those who know me you will understand that, me not swearing in any mode of communication would be the equivelant of having person with a bad case of turrets presenting childrens television.</span></p>
<p><span>I have had a few friends who have been obsessed with these Mayan scribblings and had to sit through their addled rantings about the end of times in 2012, sometimes for whole minutes.Luckily I have other friends who I could introduce these friends to before sitting by myself with a nice cup of tea.Human exinction can not be predicted because it wouldn’t be much of a surprise but there always has to be some Satan worshipping, (Stop ,no foul language, ‘nearly Debbie's Mum’.Jesus this is hard.I hope you are not one of these religious types because I am holding on to blasphemy.) worshipper who has to ruin a surprise.</span></p>
<p><span>Roland Emmerich's</span><span> ‘2012’ is an affects extravaganza, but you all knew it was going to be that anyway.</span></p>
<p><span>You want to know about the story I hear.  Is it cleverly woven,are there hidden depths and is there allegory within that has a message to us all.Are you all mad, it’s a disaster movie the weave of the story is as threadbare as old mother Hubbards kids, which will teach her to have kids so late in life.The film starts with a few cracks, that become gashes and finally everyone is shouting the sky is falling.The only depths come from the on screen tidal waves and sunamis and the allegory is America is A number 1, yaayye.</span></p>
<p><span>Roland Emmerich</span><span> has taken every natural disaster, disaster flick and woven them in to this tapestry of disaster.You know that disaster movie about the earthquake, I think it was called ‘Earthquake’, that’s in ‘2012’.You know that one about the volcano exploding, I think it was called ‘Volcano’, that’s in ‘2012’.You know that disaster film about destroying the big American city, the one that was a disaster, I think it was called ‘Godzilla’.That wasn’t in it but a lot of buildings and stuff do collapse in ‘2012’.</span></p>
<p><span>I could talk about the actors and stuff but Allah wept (equal oppurtunist blasphmer.) what does it matter.I reiterate, it is a disaster movie.The affects are great and jaw dropping, although I bet there is not just a few geologists doing some beard pulling and probably even pencil breaking and saying things like,’who wrote this balderdash’ and ‘darn Hollywood’.(These, Debbie’s mum, are UN sanactioned expletatives.) The great affects are often rudely interrupted by heavy handed, slapped in stories of heroic characters, selfish characters, characters of regret, aaahhh!! Buddah almighty, who cares.If you can go somehwere to watch this flick with some friends, (preferably none who believe in the 2012 nonsense.Oh and no geologist’s either, it will only make them angry and you wouldn’t like geologists when they are angry.) somewhere you can shout at the screen, it will be a fun couple of hours. </span></p>
<p><span>If you don’t see it though, it’s not the end of the world.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks to all who read this and Debbie’s mum.</span></p>
<p><span>Love Whakapai</span></p>
