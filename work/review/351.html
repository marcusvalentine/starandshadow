<p> Have you ever stayed to the butt end
of the credits of a 21st century blockbuster?</p>
<p>  A sad  thing to do, perhaps,  to keep
the cleaners from clearing up the mess left by buckets of pop corn. 
Geek that I am, I lingered on after Man of Steel and  tried to count
the number of people credited for the VFX ( the special FX)  After
counting upto about 1200 I gave up and left the cinema to the
cleaners.  All those names however gave me pause for thought.</p><p>In old days of 35mm I used to work as a
film editor in Soho.  I never edited a feature but did work as an
assistant editor on a number of them so  I know something about
working in the film industry.  
</p>
<p>The work in itself is enjoyable, but
when production money is tight, as it often is, you sweate blood to
get your job done.   The pay was at the high end of remuneration for
industrial work but set against that,  I was freelance and would
often hane long periods of unemployment between jobs.  And in the UK
film industry overtime was not paid.  You worked the hours God or
rather the production company sent; and in the last weeks of post
production, 16 hour days were the norm, and you might struggle even
to take your meal breaks.  
</p>
<p>When I looked  at the long lists of
credited Visual Special Effects workers at the end of blockbusters, 
I had an image.   In my mind's eye  I saw them as latter day oarsmen
chained not to benches but to their computers, and occasionally
unshackled and allowed to feed and relieve themselves.</p>
<p>As it turns out , this image has a
grain of truth.  The FX workers are feeling  hard put upon according
to an article by Janice Turner in Stage Screen and Radio. And the
material for the rest of this piece draws on Janice Turner's article.
 Please note that  Stage Screen and Radio is the journal of BECTU,
the Union for media technicians.   Janice Turner' s article may be
coming from a Union perspective but it is certainly validated by my
own experience in the film industry.</p><p>FX work has grown from being a small
add-on to productions, and developed into complete production lines
for making films that can only be made with this computer technology.
 The work is very labour intensive and involves a large number of
teams working on different aspects of the production, at the end of
which all the material generated has to be stitched together. As one
worker remarked to Janice Turner:  “Without special FX the Life of
Pi would just have been a guy in a boat with a stuffed tiger.” 
Even in 3D this would not be big box office.</p>
<p> There are 10  big FX facility
companies in the world competing for the business of the six large
studios who produce the mega blockbusters. The problem is that the
six large studios who  commission the big contracts have created the
tendering conditions where the FX companies have to compete very
keenly to get the work.  As Janice Turner says it has become a race
to the bottom on price,: the margins for the FX companies are very
thin and it is the 1000's of workers at the hard end of the tendering
process, who pick  up the tab.  In effect subsidising the movies they
create.</p>
<p>As with my own experience, wages for FX
workers are good, but their contracts are often short term and
periods of unemployment not uncommon. The workers have to put in
punishing hours, to get the work done, and in the UK overtime is
unpaid and work breaks begrudged.</p><p> A meeting of 100's of workers in
London brought these issues into the open. Continuous 40 hour long
stints in front of the computer, workers bullied into working
overtime without pay. In the US there is also anger at the way the FX
FX workers feel they are treated. The average working week is 60
hours and whilst overtime is generally paid in the  US, health care
cover is patchy. And. remembering this is a youngish work force,
heart problems, sleep problems and high blood pressure are all 
significant health issues</p><p>The problem is compounded by the fact
that this is a global industry driven by search for the best tax
breaks. With companies moving from country to country, the work 
shifts from one location to another and  many in FX industry have
become a global migrant labour force.</p><p>The FX companies themselves are
beginning to feel the heat. Their profit margins are too slim and in
the USA,  one big FX comnpany Rhythm and Hues – who did XF for Life
of PI - recently went  bankrupt  leaving its workforce high and dry. 
At the Oscars this year when the award winning Life of Pi FX team
tried to draw attention to their plight, the producers of the
ceremony cut them off and brought on the band to drown them out. 
</p>
<p>Janice Turner reports BECTU General
Secretary, Gerry Morrisey as saying: the situation where the FX
companies  impose more work with a short time scale and with unlawful
working hours cannot continue.”  The Union wants the XF companies
to form their own trade association to resist being divided and ruled
by the studios.  And the Union is continuing its work of encouraging
FX workers to join the Union and to challenge unlawful working hours
and conditions.</p><p>I suspect it will be a tough long
fight, but one that the workers and Unions will have to win if the
industry is to have a long term future in UK Europe and USA.</p><p>Thanks to Janice Turner for an article
that opened the lid on the way we should read those long lists of
names at the end of the credit rolls.
