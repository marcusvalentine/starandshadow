<p>The Other Side of Hope(<b><i><span>Toivon

Sakari Kuosmanen</p>
<p>viewed Tyneside Cinema 29 May 2017; ticket £9.75</p>

<p>thin material</p>

<p>Even though Aki Kaurismaki’s film may by the end be
something of a flat line, there is ‘hope’ in the fact that this film has been
produced.The Other Side of Hope (OSH)
comes as a relief from the corporate money return vehicles that dominate the
‘plexes at the moment.Kaurismaki’s has
written a script that starts with a perception and which he has shot without
the dominance of image, thereby allowing idea to carry the scenario.</p>

<p>The problem is that OSH is characterised by a lacking of
some inner development and consequently its creative development tapers of, and
its spirit dims&hellip;</p>

<p>The other side of hope is exactly what Kaurismaki concerns
himself with.A state of existence which has nothing to do
with plot and everything to do with seeing of a reality.Kaurismaki focuses on a psychic portrayal of Finnish society and by
extension other cultures into which asylum seekers migrate and then have to
locate and identify themselves.The
distant shore for the seekers of refuge and hope suddenly becomes actual.The seekers ofhope find themselves in intimate intercourse
with another society and have to confront and understand these forces to which
they have exposed themselves. Forces
both of inertia and reaction.</p>

<p>How do societies like Finland engage with the process of
recognising the new psychic realities represented by refugees to whom they are
suddenly conjoined?Kaurismaki uses his
camera to answer.His camera observes,
objectively as tool of observation,recording
the various responses of the Finish to the appearance of Khalid.There is no point of view, there is no
subjectivity, no off-voice interlocutor.The interaction is played straight, using only dialogue and camera. Ultimately
it is this rigidity of playing out the forces in the scenario, that traps
Kaurismaki’s film in a cycle of diminishing returns. </p>

<p>As if to provide the audience with some traction on the idea
of another perception, Kaurismaki has given OSH a production look of Finland, that
is analogous to a setting in the 1960’s /’70’s .The colour tones, most of the sets, the
costumes and props, the music, all have that period flavour.The main Finnish characters all look over 50
and present as being comfortable in Kaurismaki’s retro world.</p>

<p>By contrast the migrants are young and are the products of
the world today.</p>

<p>We see the people of
yesterday meet the people of today.</p>

<p>The film exploits on two intertwined themes that never
develop or deviate from type.The
representation of Finnish society is scripted as a one trick pony, an invariant
joke that runs through the whole film.Fins are seen as pedantic, lugubrious laborious and trapped in the
past.Fins come in two basic
types:wellmeaning or reactionary.Kaurismaki’s playing out of these stereotypes is monopaced and repetitive,
initially amusing but after an invariant hour, uninteresting.It seemed a shame that within the realm Kaurismaki
had created, he was unable to create and
release another kind of interpolation that would energise the production from a
different perspective.</p>
<p>The other dynamic in play in the script is not very
original.It comprises Kaurismaki’s take
on Ken Loach’s ‘Daniel Blake’. In
similar fashion to Daniel Blake, Khalid
is put through the grinder of the bureaucratic mill and rejected, and also targeted
by a vicious group of reactionary down and outs: the losers of Finnish society.
This element of interaction between Khalid
and Finland is mechanically portrayed predictable and uninteresting.OSH ‘s formulaic scripting in this respect
deprives the movie of any tension.In
itself lack of tension would be OK were there other compensating insights or
interpolations to energise the material.But there are notBy credit
roller Kaurismaki seems happy to have dropped the curtain on an ambiguous
ending that protects him having to make a commitment.</p>

<p>Kaurismaki may say he has made the film he intended.With its long musical interludes featuring
old Finnish dudes reliving the glory days of their youth, OSH depicts a country
locked into the past unable to relate the new realities of the 21st
century’s scenario.But as the film with
its monolithic structure becomes stuck in modes of repetition, if feels as if
Kaurismaki, like his native culture has been unable to make the transition.</p>
