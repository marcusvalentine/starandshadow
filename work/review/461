<p>Wind RiverTaylor
Sheridan (USA 2017)Jeremy Renner,
Elizabeth Olsen</p>
<p>viewed: CineWorld Newcastle 26 Sept 2017; ticket £4.00</p>

<p>One cheap cut does not a movie make</p>

<p>Sheridan has opted to make a cloyingsyrupy sub prime all American drama&hellip; A film
that ticks all the usual Hollywood post Spielberg value boxes.His idea I think was to make a film that
looked like it referenced Cohn Bros’ ‘Fargo’, full of beards and bearded mutterings
affirming rugged acentric idiosyncratic individualism; but which ultimately drew
its values from a primary statement of American decency.</p>

<p>Wind River displays an insecurity of legitimacy.A sort of tortuous white man’s guilt about
his relationship to past crimes, in this case the genocide and systematic
cultural and social undermining of the native American.The problem with the scripting is that it
pitches message first and in consequence doesn’t usethe scenario to point up what is happening.Rather it crudely showboats its concerns.Everything has to be underlined just so we
know Wind River’s ‘cred’ is right on! OK.</p>

<p>With its lone hero Cory the tracker and its FBI Jane, we
have a corresponding version ofthe
Hector /Clarince Starling relationship; the naïve female seeking advice from
the man who knows his onions. In soft
expressive cinema, this type of relationship always feels to me like
Hollywood’s coded gesture of appeasement to the feminists: that men are noble
patriarchs who will always share their knowledge on a basis of equality.  In short it feels condescending script gesture.</p>

<p>The first third of the movie is devoted to the establishment
by Sheridan of Cory’s all American
‘cowboy’ credentials.Its not really
clear why so much time is devoted to this cowboy ‘idyll’ the purpose of which
is simply to establish the protagonist as a very good man, perhaps only
slightly flawed by his ‘silence’.Sheridan makes us watch Cory’s relationship with his son Casey ( the
offspring of his estranged native Indian wife).We see Cory dutifully teaching his boy the important things: how to
handle a horse, some down home truths (philosophy) and some how to hunt stuff. Cory
is establishedas a father and a good all
American: humble but proud, honest and plain speaking, the man who sees clearly
where others do not see.The problem is
that it is predictable cliché.</p>

<p>All of which sets up the horror of the final section of the
movie in which Jane and Cory fall in love: she vocal ballsy; him strong silent
type.Of course they should get together:
the movie turns into a dating site.It
was better when the strong silent types just rode off into the distance, taming
their dating proclivities.</p>

<p>The script develops with an inexorable predictability through
to the final romancing. The good guys are good, and the bad guys bad: white
hats; dark hats. The native Americans have problems, but there is hope that
given the right conditions these problems can be overcome.</p>

<p>It is in its staging and structure that Sheridan reveals his
clumsiness in filling out the scenario. The locked gun fight sequence, when
everyone pulls out their guns at the same time.The shot doesn’t work except as a reminder that Mel Brookes and the Marx
Brothers knew how to pull off this type of idea; however they knew what they
were doing, Sheridan evidently does not.In the lead up to this locked gun fight sequence there is a major change
in shooting style.Having shot his film
conventionally in basic privileged camera access style, he suddenly reverts to
a series of drone shots taking us over the hills.Drone shots that look like they belong in
another movie.At the very least these
shots seems to suggest the opening of a new phase of the movie.But they don’t. These drone shots seem rather
to be a token of the director’s insecurity;the current idea that all movie’s made today should have a drone
sequence, just to show the audience know you know you can handle a drone.</p>

<p>Sheridan’s director’s moment comes when he invokes a cut, a
splice in the action to transport the film through time to reveal the sequence
of action that explains the core mystery of the film and its opening shots. Sheridan exploits the opening of a door, to reverse
both time and position, outside to inside.But somehow in the crudity of the film the cut seems barely more than
crass, an excuse for cleverness not insight, even the insight of an opening
door.</p>

<p>Like much of the output of today’s Hollywood, Wind River
wants to contain a bit everything to play out to the divergent constituencies
of the leisure industry.So we have some
Big John Wayne, a nod to feminism with FBI Jane, some politically correct
fathering and native American Indians. The problem is that a bit of everything
can end up with a lot of nothing.</p>
