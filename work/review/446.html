<p>EllePaul
Verhoeven (Fr 2016)Isabelle Huppert</p>
<p>Viewed Tyneside Cinema 14 Mar 2017; Ticket: £9.75</p>

<p>Many fingers in the pudding</p>

<p>Verhoeven’s ‘Elle’ like many of today’s movies, opens with
the Money.The Money people, the Investor’s names, fade
in and out through the film’s opening credits.Of course every image tells a story and after viewing the ‘Elle’
credits, if you follow the Money, you get the finance story. </p>

<p>It goes something like this.Once upon a time finance for feature films came from one or a small
number of main sources who Ok’d the project’s script, talent and production team including the director.Personal relations were often important in
getting projects off the ground and many projects although subject to the
signing off of the final cut by the Money, would more or less be left to trust,
with the director given some leeway in bringing his interpretation of the
script to realisation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My thinking is that this ‘old’ production format is now
often superseded.Now there are often a
large number of financial players investing in the production of a feature
film.The major players, TV channels and
theatrical distribution companies provide the core finance and the rationale
for other investors to come in and spread the risk endemic in the business. But
the risk has appear of low order to bring the back end finance on
board.So the normal requisites of
proven director production team and talent are of course put in place.But added to this, a new degree of attention is
paid to the script and scenario of feature movies.To attract a wider range of investors a
format of script is demanded which is qualitively different from traditional
script designs.The script has to have a
‘wow’ factor, a spectacle format as its definitive statement. Scripting craft
no longer cuts the mustard.The script
has to promise: ‘Money’. It has to have
the meachanics of money.</p>

<p>Once talent and director were in place, old Hollywood built
its scripts on the concept of ‘the through story’ more or less linked to the
idea of character/life development.The
new movie scripting does not do character development; and the through story
concept is replaced by ‘events’ which dominate and define the scenario.Modern scripts, as exemplified by’Elle’
resemble adverts.Adverts don’t do
character development, (obviously their short duration doesn’t quite allow
this) but the point of the ads is completion.In the ads the characters are completed by the product they use.The characters are usually enigmatic constructs,
emblems of desired attributes who in the script are associated with a consumer
product.The attractive woman in the
shower is completed by the washing gel that sets off her hair or her body.There is one event, or perhaps sequence of
events (as in automobile ads), that links product and character completion. </p>

<p>Like adverts contemporary scripts don’t have character
development. The characters are effectively completed by the product, which is
a developed scenario that comprises a series of events.What these ‘events’ comprise doesn’t matter
as long as they are spectacular, a huge variety of events can be bolted on to
the core of the film.The efficacy of
stylistic juxtaposition will seamlessly assemble all the parts togather. </p>

<p>Verhoeven’s Elle is constructed out of a series of events,
played out so as to escalate through the duration of the script.The characters are loose constructs
comprising of types that are representative of the demographic target
audience.Michelle Blanc is a type of
successful business woman with a type of dark past.Construed as an enigma who undergoes a
series of either real or imagined ordeals, she has no more intelligibility than
the woman in the shower gel advert.But
instead of a ‘shower event’ we have a series of ‘violent rape events’ which
complete her being in the world. The darkness of her past, the darkness of her
video game business give a phantom depth to the assaults on her body. The
script remains coy about her degree of complicity, preferring to wrap up
Michelle in the mystery of her sexual completion.This gives the film producers and the PR
department of the distributors some wriggle room in which they can disingenuously
plead the violent rape scenes may be construed as real or imagined; but that if
imagined explained by Michelle’s traumatised past.</p>

<p>Michelle’s traumatised past like most of the events in the
film feels like a bolt-on section that exists to fill out the film with
spectacle.The core of the film is the
spectacle of Michelle, legs akimbo, (Huppert performing like a inflatable sex
doll) being slapped about by a ludicrous
‘Batman-like’ intruder into her house. As this is a repetitive spectacle the
script/scenario needs bolt on events; a bad psychopathic daddy, a fallatio
scene, a lesbian scene, a sexually violent video game, a mother death bed scene,
car crash scene (without airbag!) etc.This pans out to a two hour film, some of it slightly tongue in cheek,
but a film nevertheless.None of the
bolt on’s are essential to ‘Elle’, any could have been left out without
effecting the film in any respect except its length. And half way through it is clear the movie is
painfully too long as there is almost
nothing in Elle except padding. </p>

<p>The film reviewers seem to like ‘Elle’.Film reviewers are of course part of the
assemblage of the cinema industry, and their role in the film machine is to put
bums of seats, because this is an industry, and no bums no seats no jobs.Occasionally for form’s sake they pan a movie
but for the most part they seems content to play along with the distributors PR
departments take on their products. The Independent reviewer judged that ‘Elle”
was “…unpredictable and confounded audience expectations.”In fact I have rarely seem a more predictably
dire set of events.The fact that “Elle’
has as its main character a strong successful woman played by Huppert who is an
established representative of intelligent role playing, seems to have banjaxed
reviewers into buying the PR hype and being cowed by obtuse political
correctness into giving it good review.All
those stars.</p>

<p>There is a better argument for seeing “Elle’ as demeaning
and degrading pumped up piece of film making.There are moments, mainly in the choreographed group sequences but also
in the trysts between Michelle and the masked man where Verhoeven gives a nod
to Bunuel, hints that his scenario might take on the dark surreal caste of a
Bunuel movie. But Bunuel’s films are underscored by a moral vision.Moral doesn’t make money, and Verhoeven,
after a couple of nods gets on with the simple mechanics of bolt-on film
making. Elle is the product of
opportunistic hypocrisy that presents sexual violence as spectacle, wrapping up
fake female empowerment as a saleable product that can make the return on Money.
And speaking of money, Isabelle Huppert
could make a bundle selling anti-wrinkle cream.</p>
