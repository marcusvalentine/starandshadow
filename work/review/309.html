<p>Honour of the Knights (Honor de Cavalleri)Albert Serra(Sp 2008)Lluis
Carbo; Lluia Serrat.</p>
<p>Viewed Star and Shadow Cinema (Newcastle AV festival)15 March 2012; ticket price £5.00</p>

<p>Touched by immanence</p>

<p>Honour of the Knights (HK) is about the immanence of
vision.I note that some critics
have commented that Serra’s (AS) interpretation of Don Quixote depicts an
aimless rambling.But I don’t
think this is the case, it is simply that the film’s actual movement is not so
much upon the earthly domain rather it is on the metaphysical or celestial
plane.</p>

<p>HK is grounded in the contrasting physicality of the two
principle actors. The squire Sancho presents as a mass, a mountain a colossal
being of the earth, a man of the clay.That he can move at all seems in defiance of gravity, an act of will to
move when his physical nature seems to demand immobility. Yet when he moves he
has a lightness of foot, a nobility of demeanour and when in water the
effortless motion of the cetacean.The knight is a being almost without body.A body that is ethereal even when strapped into his metal
cuirasses and pauldrons. It is as if he were not there, an immaterial being
locked into the material. With his whitened hair, pale skin, white chemise,
Quixote,a shimmering luminescence.</p>

<p>And there is no doubt as to who leads who follows. The earth
bound, head bowed squire follows the knight who head upmoves upward released into his
vision.AS takes Cervantes tale
and extracting a critical motif, makes it his own. AS recasts Don Quixote as a
fable from an age now past where spirit guided the body. Not always
successfully perhaps, but nevertheless a fabled time when the desires of the
body ultimately cededprimacy to
the yearnings of the spirit.A
fable of course, but in an era defined by the over arching imperative of
consumption and the circuits that amplify individual desires, it’s a shock to
be presented, even in fabulous form,with a simple statement of another possibility, another way of
being.</p>

<p>Quixote is of course moving, and moving with huge
acceleration towards death.It is
not a death that is oppressive of life.It’s a death that is at one with life.Death thatQuixote equates with the oneness ofGod.God is all
creation in immanent form.To die
is simply to experience this oneness.Quixote is a becoming more luminous as he moves through the keys of
nature into vision.It is vision
that attracts Quixote and vision is the metaphysical gravity that attracts him
upwards pulling him out of his body out of the skin bones and white chemise,
that contain but no longer delimit him.</p>

<p>Theworld is an
evil place corrupted by actions of men but the chivalric calling transcends
it.As Quixote moves on his
journey he realises the presenting power of water, the presenting power of the
trees of the moon and the sky. Their intensity signifies the nature of the
world and of man,as being God
given.It is an insight that
is mystical whether in the Sufi Christian or Hindu tradition, where life is
union.</p>

<p>HK is realised with defining simplicity by AS.The film comprises only of exteriors
which are shot both day and night without lighting.The shots sequences and dialogues are refined to simple
gesture both of body and speech. The editing decisions are never based on match
cutting or continuity in reverse shots, but seem to have been made to affirm
the integrity of ‘the moment’ whether it be Sancho’s bodily integrity or
Quixote’s translucent integrity as his voice affirms the presence of God and
his body and face reflect the affect of this realisation. </p>

<p>I think for AS Sancho follows Quixote because he realises a
lackinga void within
himself.Sancho does not perhaps
understand the transformed state of mind of Quixote.He does not understand or share Quixote’s vision of
immanence of life and death. Sancho does understand that Quixote’s vision is
something that is important and that if he can be of use to Quixote then this
will have been of worthwhile importance.Perhaps in time Sancho will understand things better. Or not.But for now he can be useful in an
ultimate sense of the term, helping a man to die well.</p>
