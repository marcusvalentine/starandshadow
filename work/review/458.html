<p>City of GhostsMatthew Heineman (USA; 2017)</p>
<p>Viewed Tyneside Cinema 26 July 2017; ticket:£9.45</p>

<p>yes but who are the ghosts?</p>

<p>Heineman’s film is about the group of Raqaa citizens who
after IS steamed into Raqqa set themselves to oppose the invaders and called
themselves:Raqqa is Being Slaughtered
Silently.</p>

<p>The IS slaughter in Raqqa is silent because IS carried
through a policy of cutting off Raqqa from the outside world so that no word,
or at least a few words as possible about what was happening there could reach
the ears of the world.</p>

<p>City of Ghosts gives a coherent background to the IS entry
and take over of the city. We are shown the initial protests and riots against
Assad’s regimen, leading to a revolution and uprising against that corrupt regime
that successfully expelled it from the city.Cue picture: the triumphant entry of IS into Raqqa and the
institution of the IS regime, heralded
by their ideological proclamations that it marked the beginnings of a new era
in the history of the world: the age of the second caliphate.</p>

<p>This we see.What we
don’t see is what happened in that interval of time between the expulsion of
Assad and the entrance of IS.It is not
addressed.It is glossed over.</p>
<p>But there are some questions that might be raised.Did eminent or influential factions inside
Raqqa invite the IS investment of the town?Or did IS just turn up and walk in, more or less unannounced?Did anyone in Raqqa understand the
implications of IS investment of their city?These are ghost questions and they haunt Heienman’s movie as much as any
ghosts that he intends to reference in his title. </p>

<p>We see, though perhaps a little incoherently, the
consequences ofIS cleansing and purifying
Raqqa with the execution of those judged to either have resisted IS or not to have
met the new standards of respect and behaviour now required in a city privileged
to be the capital of final perfect expression of Islam.</p>

<p>Witnessing the turn of events, the occupation of Raqqa by a
homicidal regime using systematic intimidation and summary execution to
maintain their rule, a small group of mostly young politically naïve men become
active resisters.Trained up in
journalistic techniques by Naji, one of their number (later assasinated in
Turkey by IS), they call themselves:Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently (RBSS).Their objective was to tell the world what
was happening in the city;and also
using graffiti posters small zines let the occupying killers know that there is
opposition. </p>

<p>It seems at first their opposition was although dangerous, relatively easy and reasonably successful.They were able to carry through many of their
objectives. Of course to be caught would
entail an inevitable sentence of torture and death by beheading.But as IS’s occupation tightened their
resistance and getting the stories out of Raqqa became more difficult.Most of the original band as they were unmasked
managed to escape. RBSS split into two groups: émigrés and internees, the
latter a highly clandestine group probably organised either in very small cells
or even as individuals.The émigrés,
mostly based in Turkey and Germany were tasked with publicising the situation inside
Raqqa to the media and on the web.The
inside story of Raqqa was provided with ever greater difficulty by the small
group of informants left behind in the city. </p>

<p>The émigrés are subject to severe personal pressures: depression
and stress.Moving from safe house to
house across Europe they face the daily threat of assassination by Isis.But also they have to live with their own absence
from the city, the cumulative death of friends and family, both from IS and
allied air strikes.They also have to
deal with their own feelings of inadequacy and guilt.Both the actual (the threats by IS to kill
them) and psychological difficulties the group face are recorded by Heineman.Their bravery, their resourcefulness, their
resolve their determination all documented in Heineman’s film.And their courage is honoured.</p>

<p>The problem with City of Ghosts is that it has an empty
centre.We see at the beginning of the
film, the uprising against the Assad regime.We understand something about these initial forces set in play, even
though as I intimated above there are unasked questions about IS ‘s take over
of Raqqa.But from the moment that IS
take over Raqqa, we understand very little. The movie is suddenly decontextualized
, full of ghost entities.</p>

<p>We have the provocation of IS’s legitimation of murder and
summary execution and the consequentdetermination by a small group to fight IS by proclamation of the truth
about what was going on.But Heineman
is unable to address the issue of IS themselves.The thread of the movie’s aetiology is
exclusively tied to the indistinct film of the porn of the IS summary
executions.Pertinent questions are not
even addressed: who constituted IS, who
were they, what were they doing, and how successful were they in carrying
through their various social educational administrative programmes?</p>

<p>It seems strange that in Heineman’s film there is no
indication of who IS were?From where
were the fighters, judges, bureaucrats of Isis drawn?Were they mostly known citizens of Raqqa who
were happy to buy their privileged survival with quisling service to the warped
practice and tenets of IS?Were they
foreigners, either from other parts of the Syria, or from wider areas? Did IS feel like gangsters who had taken over
town?Or were there there perceptively
different strata among IS?What were
the impressions of IS by the people with whom they came into contact?Were some simple psychopaths and crazies,
were some obviously devout Muslims, did any one see signs that some IS people
might not embrace all of the brutality of the regime?What was the role of women? Did the city
start to feel riddled with IS informers?</p>

<p>It seems amazing that a film originating in the heart of IS
territory, its proclaimed capital, does not in any manner touch on something
about the nature composition and organisation of the regime that oppressed
them.Or is the truth too close to home?
Are the real ghosts the collaborators?</p>

<p>What form did life in Raqqa take on after IS took over?Was there rationing, did IS requisition most
food for themselves? Schools, medical services, shops, transport…how did they
change through the occupation?</p>

<p>Heineman’s film in the end lacks any ambition to place his
brave subjects in the context of IS in Raqqa. According
to the Heineman’s logic in the film, RBSS organise their resistance about those
terrible indistinct clips of people being executed in the Raqqa main
square.But again the movie is unable or unwilling to
give us information about these ghosts.One of them, a cousin of one of the RBSS group seems to be a victim, but
as for the rest those seen in clips and those unseen, we are given no
information.They are become objects.</p>

<p>Of course
indiscriminate murder is a sufficient reason to oppose.But the feeling from Heineman is that these
terrible mundane images of execution are
enough to justify his film.The film can
be legitimised about these images and the action of RBSS sufficiently
explained.My feeling is is that
Heineman’s failure to at least probe more deeply his respondents experience of
IS in Raqqa, has as its consequence that it is IS that are the real ghosts of
his movie. </p>

<p>And of course it is traumatically ironic that as the film is
released Raqqa is being pulverised from land and air by the allies.Raqqa’s citizens are dieing in their hundreds
under American and Russian bombs and Syrian Arms ordinance.They are still silent.A people with no voice, a people who are
simply images for the 24 hour news channels.Objects as they are pulled out of rubble or lie in blood soaked field
hospital cots waiting for a doctor. </p>
