<p>Pierrot le Fou   J-L Godard ( Fr 1965) 
Anna Karina, Jean Paul Belmondo</p>
<p>Viewed Star and Shadow Cinema 6 June
13;  ticket £5</p><p>Pierrot le Fou (PF) in which Godard 
potently reconstituting himself as Pierrot le Fou, takes the road
movie into the new era.</p><p>Setting out the stall</p>
<p>In an early sequence in the movie, at a
typical high tone bourgeios party, Pierrot (aka Ferdinand –
Belmondo) meets Sam Fuller the American film director. Pierrot asks
him what movies are. Fuller replies that movies are like war,
battles, money,  people.   Fuller ends by concluding that:  in short
films are emotions.</p><p>Godard in PF lays out his cinema stall
in a manner that is both in accord with and in contradistinction to
Mr Fuller.  For Godard (G) cinema is PASSION;  passion in the making
of films.  That's where the emotion is:  not so much in sentiments
expressed on screen, but rather emotion as registered in the
intensity with which the ideas and  multivariant signage are folded
into the material.  Godard's films are wars, but fought with ideas,
ideas expressed as only cinema expresses them: in a riot of image
text sound and graphics.  Godard's films are passionate about
thinking;  what it is possible to think; and how film, with its
collision of inputs, makes possible different types of thinking.</p><p>G's protagonist Pierrot is a fusion of
clown and gangster.  Pierrot as a type, the disillusioned romantic,
points to the idea of clown.  But Pierrot le Fou was also the
soubriquet of a ruthless French gangster of the 1940's, a true mean
bastard.  It seems to me that of the two fused personas, the clown is
the basis of the character;  it is the gangster who points to the way
out, on the run, to the road.</p><p>My feeling is that it is G himself who
is this fused hoodlum–clown. The role is played wondrously by
Belmondo, but the creation is the projection of Godard's schizo
nature;  part gangster a restless transgressive figure who hates the
Bourgoisie, and is alienated and distanced from their world.: and
clown.  As Pierrot his search for escape is doomed by his hopeless
romantic love for Columbine ( Karina), whom he can never win and who
will always drop him in the shit.</p><p>The poetic fate of both clown and
gangster is death.  Godard's genius was to create this cultural
avatar of hoodlum clown and depict him in film as a satirical
response to the conditions characteristic of life in the AMERICAN
century.</p>
<p>Road movies existed before PF, but I
think it is G who gave this the genre its definitive post modernist
form.  In PF G replaces the mechanics of  plot with process.  It is a
working out.  The road is a pure process, and PF, a psychofilm.  The
series of cameos on the run provoke  dialogues between the
characters and the world, using the multivariant nature of the
possibities of encounters on the road to elicit social and political
observations and statements.</p><p>After the brilliantly inventive opening
titles, which announce the movie as a magical circus, PF plunges into
the bath with Belmondo, who is looking at a book about Valasquez. 
The book depicts Valasquez as the Court painter, but an outsider, 
who in  old age saw through the empty shallowness of power, and
perceived in the peripheral figures of the Court, the dwarves and
clowns, a twisted manifestation of the emptiness of regal life.</p><p>And so Pierrot is set up.   Like
Velasquez he is an outsider looking into the vacuity of a class of
people, in this case the bourgeiosie,  and the parody of Americanised
cullture and society they have adopted.  Further the montage of the
paintings that accompanies the discussion of Valasquez,  also serves
to alert the viewer that PF will comprise a structure that engages
states of mind rather than the mechanicality of narative linearity.  
The film's structure with interpolated paintings and graphics images
breaks up conditoned responses, challenges the primacy of reason and
asks the viewer how they understand what they see.</p><p>The Vietnam war runs as a leitmotif
thorugh PF.   G inserts into PF newspaper headlines magazines photos
newsreel and most stunning of all a clown show, in which Madeleine
(Karina) transforms herself into a Vietnamese Columbine as a piece of
mime in which she is playfully and casually shot, at point blank
range, by  Pierrot.  The power of the Vietnam material lies in its
random eruption into the film.  Without a logic other than that of
necessity, Vietnam is spliced into the action.  The rudely extruded
imagery of course points up the contradiction of normalisation.  The
televising of the Vietnam war has led to it becoming just another
passing image, that might attract our attention momentarily but then
just go away.  Godard understood that the effect of  24 hour war
coverage was to desensitize us and to normalize killing, but also in
a more complex way it allowed us in the West to feel that we knew
about it, without knowing anything at all about it.  It's a long way
from but also close to home.</p><p>PF is a rolling parody of affects and
sentiments, one highlight being the sequence on the dock where the
man tries to sing his song to Pierrot. One constant satiric theme
throughout the scenario is the manner in which G depicts a society
that is colonised by the outlook manner and attitudes of desire and
consumption.  The advertising industry. The actual effect of 
advertising is not to persuade us to buy this or that product.  
Rather advertising changes the whole gamut of social relations that
operate between people and between institutions.  These relations
become based on consumption: on a psychic atmosphere of desire.   The
cumulative power of advertising, in our culture extends beyond its
evident material presence in magazines on billboards in cinema and
tv, to become an internalised social reality.   Advertising is the
way we are. Advertising is the power of propaganda which immobilises
and neutralises alternative thinking.</p>

<p>The clown and the gangster point to the
way out.
