<p>The Brand New Testament(le Tout Nouveau Testament)Joco Van Dormael (2015 Bel) Benoit Poelvoorde, Pili Groyne, Catherine
Deneuve</p>

<p>Viewed Tyneside Cinema 10 May 2016; ticket (matinee
screening) £8.25</p>

<p>Pollyanna Pollyfilla</p>

<p>I was wondering before checking in to see Van Dormael’s movie
whether it would be a black 21st century comedy in the style of
Belvaux’ 1992 movie Man Bites Dog?Would
Brand New Testament wrap up, implicate me in another dark Belgium vision of European society?Belvaux’ movie was a bleak vision of 20thst
century man but justified itself by its truth commitment and unflinching camera
that pointed to the consequences for lives colonised by the invasion of the
media.</p>

<p>In the age of Facebook, instagram, twitter what insights
would Van Dormael’s film open up to probe our interconnected narcissistic
culture?Questions!</p>

<p>Questions largely unasked so thereby unanswered by the Brand
New Testament.</p>

<p>The movie starts with a dystopian premise.Van Dormael invents his own version of ‘God’
in the form of a blue collar slob who controls the world through his
computer.God works out of a virtual
subprime apartment located far from anywhere.In his omnipotence God spends ‘time’ torturing humanity by inventing malevolent
laws; in his downtime he abuses his wife, the Goddess, and his daughter
Ea.Ea finally decides she’s had “enough”
and revenges herself on dad (God).She logs onto dad’s computer and texts ‘everyone’
(at least everyone with a smart phone) with the exact hour of their death,
including a helpful countdown so they can keep tabs on their progress to hour
zero.After disabling the computer she escapes
down a worm hole to Earth to get away and to try to rectify some of the bad dad
has done.Just like bro JC.</p>

<p>At this point, rather early in the scenario, the the film
breaks down, unable to sustain the weight of its own internal logic or to
handle the critical implication of the death countdown for human and social
relations.The count down to death is an
idea beyond the imaginative scope of Van Dormael’s film to handle.Van Dormael doesn’t have the conceptual
resources to represent this idea.His
character God is vexed that Ea’s actions in revealing to people the hour of
their death “…has taken them out of his power, cut out the fun.”But the film never seems to take this idea on.
Van Dormael’s script opts for his particular subjects to revert to kind of
infantilism, death releases the 100 things to do before you die fantasy.Hence the need for Polyanna to appear as the
girly amanuensis.Otherwise, outside
the little cameos that comprise the movie life mainly goes on as before. </p>

<p>Van Dormael’s main expressive tools are not conceptual but literal
depictions of ideas event situations.So
he has recourse to SFX and digital tech to show us actual things rather than to
represent concepts filmicaly.</p>

<p>Abandoning the conceptual situation, the death countdown, it
has proposed,the Brand New Testament
concentrates on Ea who becomes a Pollyanna figure selecting 6 people she will
help out on their way to their appointment with death.She hears their inner music (biased towards
the Baroque composers as presumably there was limited budget for expensive
copyright clearance), and encourages them to fulfil themselves before they die
thereby revealing the movie’s cheap ambition to betray European scepticism and
embrace an all American ethos of dream fulfilment: the middle class ambition of
overcoming.Things to do before you die,
ensure you get Eurimages distribution.</p>

<p>The Brand New Testament as it progresses loses cohesion and
becomes a medley of parallel cut disconnected events and situations.</p>

<p>There is also another level at which the film betrays a
disturbed level of filmic consciousness.</p>

<p>Although the ‘God’ premise and the ‘death’ premise both call
up the idea of a whole (the God idea the death idea affect everyone) Van
Dormael fails to connect with any posited whole.The society we see in his scenario is
represented only by white people (mostly middle class).Blacks, immigrants, Moslems, Jews are all
absent.Completely absent.For a movie that sets out to encompass the
whole of society this is a strange omission.It would have been a funny had Van Dormeul’s ‘God’ invention just been a
god of white folks. Brand New Testament
in this situation could have been a requiem for white man society. But this does not seem to have been the idea.We just have another disconnected film
unrelated to European ‘society’ in which we live, because most of the people
are simply ignored.Non ‘whites’ written out of the script
probably because it was felt to be too complex to include them and simpler to
revert to Pollyanna scenario. Whites only.</p>

<p>As Brand new Testament progresses it resorts to ever
increasing use of SFX, the digital filling in for the lamentable lack of actual
interest. The film finishes with a sort of soggy biscuit finale where the
Goddess (God’s wife) inadvertently stops the death countdown and invents
Patterned skies instead of clouds, making everyone feel happy.What patterned skies might do for global warming is
amoot point, but what is certain is
that Van Dormael ends with a complete cop out to the soft porn of political
correctness.</p>
