<p>I Am Not Your NegroRaoul Peck; written by James Baldwin (2016 USA)Samuel Jackson</p>
<p>viewed Film Forum NYC, 21st Feb 2017; ticket $8.00</p>

<p>one voice</p>

<p>As I left the cinema with my companion Ana Marton, she
turned to me and said: It’s a labour of love!And I immediately understood that she was right because if there is one
thing that stands out in Raoul Peck’s ‘I
Am Not Your Negro , it is that there is love at the heart of his film. </p>

<p>‘I Am Not Your Negro’ feels like the film of a director who
has read and reread James Baldwin many times, each time absorbing him the more
deeply into his blood.Reaching the
point, from all considerations, where a film, not made about but with Baldwin,
was possible.A film in which not
everything could be said, but in which much that was essential in the writer
could be uttered.</p>

<p>Viewing ‘I Am Not Your Negro’it feels like Raoul Peck (RP) has consciously
minimised his own presence, almost disappeared from the film. Because this is
Baldwin’s film.And RP knows he has made
Baldwin’s film and no one should take the credit for Baldwin’s film but
Baldwin.His is the voice.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Of course ‘I Am Not Your Negro’is a finely crafted film and in that respect
it is Peck’s seamless fusion of Baldwin’s strong voice and the film material that
almost renders his own presence invisible.RP writes himself out of the script allowing him to refine his task so
as to actualise the life and writing of the poet and writer who has inspired
and shaped the lives of those many born without the protective carapace ofwhite skin.</p>

<p>Raoul Peck’s intention in the film is to give total primacy
to the writing.Nothing is more
important.Baldwin’s writing commands
the screen, allowing his voice to ring clearly across the years since his death
in 1987. Releasing Baldwin’s words so that they might resonate today
with acuity intelligence and insight into the heart of present day America. </p>

<p>An America that in Baldwin’s terms is still a sick troubled
society.Baldwin’s predictions bear
witness today to the primacy of Donald Trump;perhaps a sickermore troubled
culture now than in the 1960’s and 1970’s epitomised in the continuing fate of
its black population to be looked upon as a despised degenerate slave
people.A fate made more urgent and
cogent by the fact that the political discourse about ‘blacks’ is spoken in a euphemistic
code of political correctness that overlays the deeply buried prejudice and
discrimination. </p>

<p>Peck’s script is
largely based on Baldwin’s 1975 work, ‘No name in the street’.This is sometimes described as a group of
essays.It is not.It is rather an autobiographical work that is
structured in the manner of a stream of consciousness.It intermixes the personal memory, reflection
and analysis of white culture and society, and interpolates into the text the
significance and deaths of the the three great black American resistance
figures of the 20th century, with all of whom, Baldwin had worked
and fought.Medgar Evans, Malcolm X,
Martin Luther King. </p>

<p>Baldwin’s utterance, voiced by the deep sonorous bass of
Samuel Jackson, is the dominant affect
inthe movie, Baldwin’s
writing is the truth content, energising and organising the visual material, the
affect that points to the significance of the visual imagery.What we see is images that are an extension
of the voice’s perception:images drawn
from originary material of Baldwin himself such as his 1965 Cambridge debate;
archive material of King Evans and Malcolm X; and movie clips from popular Hollywood film
that range from the 1920’s to the 1970’s. In addition RP makes some use of present day
coverage of race riots in Milwaukie and Ferguson to extend the scope of
Baldwin’s vision into the present day, and to give the lie to the endless
stream of white faces appearing on televisions to tell the black people that
they are: “Sorry!”.Sorry for what?</p>

<p>And: ‘I Am Not Your
Negro’did not win a 2017 Oscar. No
surprise. The boys and girls in the Hollywood back rooms were never going to
give the gong to James Baldwin. I mean you have to take the film’s title
seriously.Baldwin’s idea was to tell
truth, his truth: not to entertain.Thanks
RP.</p>
