<p>Iron Man 3     Shane Black (USA 2013) 
Robert Downey Gwynith Paltrow</p>
<p>Viewed Empire Cinema Newcastle upon
Tyne  Ticket: £3.75</p>
<p>Spontanious Human Bullshit  
</p>
<p>All I can remember about Iron Man One
was that it was full of  commercial product placements and as I
didn't use these sort of products,  I didn't go to see
Iron Man 2, but I thought I'd check into Iron Man 3.</p>
<p> As 3 D makes me feel sick  this review
is from 2 D land, so I didn't get the full on CGI show; but I can
report that in Iron Man 3, there wasn't a pack shot in sight.  The
camera turns its lens away from commercial products like a vestal
virgin averting her eyes from the naked statue of Heracles at
Helicarnassus.  
</p>
<p>So what did I see in Iron Man 3. 
</p>
<p>The writers of Iron Man 3, Drew Pierce
and Shane Black,  seem to have been sensitised, perhaps at an early
and impressionable stage in their writing careers to the creative
possibilities of Spontaneous Human Combustion.  Spontaneous Human
Combustion (or SHC) is the  idea that human beings without warning,
can spontaniously burst into flames, catch fire inside themselves and
burn themselves out from within like a candle ,before being reduced
to small sad pile of ashes.  The heat produced in cases of SHC is
intense enough to consume all flesh and bone of the unfortunate
deceased.  Dickens used SHC in Bleak House to dispose of one of his
characters, interstingly an alcoholic.  The writers of Iron man of
course take the idea put a few nobs on it and give it the mad
scientist treatment in the character of  Aldrich.  
</p>
<p>An experiment by Aldrich - the 'Bad
Guy' - to induce  extreme internal heat to cure drug addicts and
alcoholics (?) goes badly wrong.  The unfortunate subjects of the
experiment burn out and blow everyone up.  However in this disaster
Aldrich sees - opportunity - as he says: Failure is the fog through
which success is glimpsed.  So he develops his heat treatment, not to
give people a nice tanned look, but to turn people into his personal
army of red hot soldiers – litterally. To the casual gaze these hot
rods look just like you and me, but at the command of Aldrich they
use their internal heat to unleash fire brimstone and death upon his
enemies.</p>
<p>It's an idea that didn't occur to the
more prosaic Dickens, but this take on SHC by the scriptwriters
provides the movie with an army of formidable enemies for Iron Man to
biff and Iron Man likes nothing better than biffing a few bad guys. 
And  they are well met:  Iron Man spends a lot of time bolted into
his metal exoskeleton, and Aldrich's  hot rod soldiers  do their best
to make things hot for him inside the suit.</p>
<p>The plot if you can call it that, its
not so much a plot, more a couple of sets of book ends that serve to
keep the unruly meandering set pieces in some sort of time line. 
After an opening cod philosophical quote of the kind that Terrence
Malik has a lot to answer for (the film opens with the portentous
voice of  Iron Man intoning for our instruction  and edification, the
sentence:  'We create our own demons.')  Indeed we do.</p>
<p>Anyway after this first Terrence Malik
moment, we are whisked off to a scientific convention:  Berne 1999
It's  an opening sequence in which Iron Man gives Aldrich – the bad
guy – the cold shoulder.  He stands him up, forgetting to meet him
on the roof on the convention hotel.  You see Iron man has the hots
for a fruity lady scientist and more interesting things to do than
keep an assignation with a geeky young inventor.</p>
<p>Now some people might think forgetting
an appointment was just one of those things that happen.  Shit
happens.  But not your man Aldrich.  No! This event dominates his
life and he takes out a vow of revenge on the whole world, the whole
cosmos for Iron Man's unforgivable slight.  In the nineteenth century
Aldrich would have sent his seconds round to ask Iron Man for
satisfaction.  In the twenty first century that's not enough: he has
to destroy the world and every one in it to get his own back.    
</p>

<p>That's it really !  In a way the movie
is a computer game scenario based on the 'Quest' idea.  Stark aka as
Iron Man has to find and nullify Aldrich before he ends the world as
we know it and the American way of life become history. The script
exploits a number of well know game characters:  the wise child, the
warrior woman, the buddie, the fool, the bad guy, to cue a series of
CGI set pieces of graphic intensity.  
</p>
<p>You know the kind of thing: an army of
CGI technicians, thousands of them, lackies chained to computers,
produce a series of extrordianry images and  effects even seen in 2D:
explosions on land sea and air, everything you see blows up, there's
fire, the earth quakes people dieing horribly by the bucket load.  
And another CGI effect also impresses: whenever he needs to fight the
good fight, Stark simply whistles up his exoskeleton and  piece by
piece, it hurtles through space and time and bolts itself onto him,
transforming him into a Medieval looking  warrior  A knight in armour
 going forth to save damsels and do good.  Stark is also fashionably
scripted with anxiety attacks and doubt, but protected, in the
script, not by the word of God, but by Terrence Malick type gnomic
utterances.</p>
<p>The other plot device of note is
supplied by Ben Kingsley as the Mandarin.  The scenario initially
creates the impression that the mayhem and destruction abroad in the
world is being orchestrated by a comic book Bin Laden look alike,
called the Mandarin.  The film in exploiting the physical
similarities of the Mandarin and Bin Laden walks a tricky line from
the point of view of setting up Jihad as plot driver.  
Undiscriminating audiences may take the suggestion implicit in the
image of the Mandarin and connect it with Jihad.  And they may not be
sophisticated enough to uncouple Jihadists and mainstream Islam.  For
the film to connect Islam and the annihilation of the USA is to move
into criminally culpable zone of incitement.  But Iron Man 3 resolves
the device of the Mandarin half way through the movie.   It is
revealed that the Mandarin is a spoof.  He is in fact only an actor
called Trevor.  The Mandarin, the Bin Laden look alike is simply a
hapless frontman for the real evil presence, the dread Aldrich, the
clean white boy who was slighted all those years ago by Iron Man and
is now exacting his terrible revenge.</p>
<p>The problem with revelation that the
Mandarin is in fact only a stooge is that this leaves an implausible
gap in the film's motivational mechanism.   Is revenge for being
stood up by Iron Man a sufficiently strong reason to explain why the
world has tobe destroyed?   Is there perhaps some homerotic undertone
at work?  Is all this terrible destruction a simple psychic
statement,  Aldrich's way of telling Iron Man that he really loves
him?</p>
<p>This is possible.  But might there be
some other purpose lurking within the film's concoction?   Why have
all these CGI compositors and artists been put to work to make this
film?  Was it only to indulge the audience's need to gaze on the 
detailed mechanics of the annihilation of the world? Or is there
something else at work in the script? 
</p>
<p> I thought about this and it occurred
to me that perhaps the whole film was an allegory?   I wondered if it
was an allegory connected to scientology?  I mean Hollywood is full
of scientologists these days&hellip; OK I agree the world can do without
another conspiracy theory&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;but the more I think about
it&hellip;Iron Man somehow epitomises the idea of the superior being
evolving out of the limitations of the human species.  This
proximates to the Scientology myth that homo sapiens is not the fully
evolved article; he needs to be further developed by technology.  
With his exoskeleton Iron Man is the fusion of technology and flesh 
that is the promise of Scientology which belives we were once
superior life forms called Thetans who have since degenerated.  So 
</p>
<p>The Scientology proposition is that we
have to evolve and reclaim out Thetan identity; or we, as a race,
will perish because of our evil our pusillanimity and weakness.  Iron
Man is a prototype operating Thetan, an advanced technological type
who like Ron Hobbard opens the doors to others who are ready:  the
child the woman the man, enabling them to realise their true techie
identity.  In so doing Iron Man defeats evil  and helps those who can
to develop their Thetan identities.   
</p>
<p>Far fetched perhaps.  If you looking
for high tech effects that roll down over you off the screen and
flatten you, then go see Iron Man 3.  If you crave meaning from Iron
Man then it'll have to be a do-it-yourself job. Thetans or bust.</p>
