<p>God's Pocket   John Slattery (USA 2014) Philip Seymour, Christina
Jenkins, Richard Jenkins 
</p>
<p>Viewed Empire Cinema Newcastle UK 12 AUG 2014; ticket: £3.50</p>How to lose your soul
<p>God’s Pocket reminded me of Carson McCullers’
work.  Slattery’s film, based on Pete Dexter’s novel though
set in the North rather than the South, has that same feeling of
pervasive decay attaching to it;  a decay of community
registered in the sepia grain of its colour.</p>
<p>God’s Pocket is set in the 1980’s,  and
basks in the eternal etiolated twilight of  ‘50’s America. 
A place where filmmakers go when they want to find somewhere the
human face and the human body not computers iPhones and tablets, are
the interlocutors between people.  A vanished world.  A
vanishing America.   
</p>
<p>So this is a movie about place and the qualities that
people bring to their neighbourhoods.  As an ensemble piece
centred on the eponymous small community of God's Pocket it invites
some comparison with the films  Frank Capra made in the1940’s
celebrating small town America:  It’s a Wonderful Life, Mr
Smith goes to Washington.  Capra’s movies were optimistic
affirmations of American values; decency individualism and
democracy.  Looked back on the films have an inherent charm, but
the scripting’s were not representative in any meaningful way of
blue collar working class  or minority groups. They were an
idealistic rendering of a homogenous America, a setting with apposite
values later exploited by Spielberg’s suburban dream. 
Nevertheless as expressions of an idealised people Capra’s films
were powerful sentimental models.</p>
<p>Slattery’s film moulded around the face and body of
Mickey (played by Seymour), comes across as a  particular statement
about the way things are today.  Not of aspirational hope or
optimism in the values of US society, but a study of decadence. 
A society that is dilapidated, coming apart in the constant flux of
unravelling values.  A society that partially lame hobbles on.  It
is not so much the people of God’s Pocket who are degraded rather
the system, the social and economic matrix.  The people respond
as best they can to the pressures within which they have to survive.
 We’re looking at a broken machine held together by human
resilience.   Even for the ‘respectable’ inhabitants of
the neighbourhood, those trying to work, the small business people,
everyday life is circumscribed and penetrated by debt gangsters and
crime.  These people pay the 'Goodfellahs’ whores.  And
they now have to ‘whore’ for themselves to exist.</p>
<p>Initially the film’s structure is woven about a
Voice Over, the words of Richard Shelburn, a journalist on the local
newspaper whose poetic insight into the community again reminds me of
McCullers prose ( She must have been an inspiration to many writers
of Dexter's generation).    It’s not so much a Voice Over
but almost a Greek Chorus a heightened poetical polemic whose muse is
truth.  What develops in God’s Pocket is that this chorus,
Richard's voice  gradually leaves the wings and takes on a full
frontal character in the script.  Richard Shelburn moves from
being a voice off to having an identity, a physical presence, an
active role and to finally being centre stage.</p>
<p>There is scope in terms of script and film structure
for a Voice to become a flexible component in a  film's structure.
Too many films are structured about Voice Over narration that is
predictable and flabby, comprising a Ready-Brek solution to core
scriptive and filmic problems.  So the idea of a Voice that
elides into a different type of dramatic presence has transformative
possibilities.</p>
<p>In God’s Pocket I think this movement of voice into
presence doesn’t work.   It feels like the intrusion of
what is a subjectivity into collectivity.   The elemental
basis of God’s Pocket is its collective character which is
reflected in its  ensemble playing.  The community is a
decaying matrix of family ethnic and business ties corrupted by debt
and gangsterism.  Slattery brings this complex of relations into
play through the device of a sudden death  that agitates the
community sending a series of adaptive and sometimes violent ripples
across its surface.    
</p>
<p> Interestingly the key filmic component of the
collective playing is not the wide shot but the close up.  The face
reacts to relations, and by framing his camera on the face and body,
Slattery negotiates the ebb of flow of emotions deals and conflict. 
One of the strenghts of God's Pocket film is the use of the face to
reveal the nature of these interconnecting reactions.  But more than
this the face suggests the strands of consciousness and cognizance
that lie below its surface. In the strong scene in the bookies, with
bets on,   it feels possible to see beneath the surface of the
expressions in the faces of the two gamblers and pick up the scent of
drugs and protection rackets that undelay this culture.   
</p>
<p>The intrusion of the journalist, Richard Shelburn,
into the story is an individualist intrusion that undermines the core
collective substance of the film without any compensating benefit. 
The final centre stage liaison between Richard and Jeannie (Mickey’s
wife) feels like a mechanical device.  It betrays the film in a
number of ways. It undermines any moral dimension to Jeannie. 
OK, she is in a way peripheral (all the women in God’s Pocket
are peripheral), but even in her peripherality she conveys a certain
insistent strength of character.  The idea that she fucks an old
celebrity journalist because he spouts some tired old prose at her
(the fucking in God’s Pocket is joyless pump house  style). 
It’s a scripting decision that demeans her.  A device to work
Richard from the back stage to front of house.  A device that
only succeeds in debasing the movie.  Changing it from gold to lead.
Slattery may argue that the device eventually allow the repressed
violence of  God's Pocket to be revealed.  But we get this
eliptically from the body of the movie without needing to see Richard
kicked to death.</p>
<p>God's Pocket is a movie that doesn’t so much have a
narrative but works by creating a world of collective
interconnectivity that is undermined by a liaison that takes place
outside its own parameters of significance, crudely interpolated and
without compensating gain for the audience in either insight
revelation or even tension.   </p>
<p>So long as it remains true to its collective focus
God’s Pocket unfolds as a series of expressive vignettes of blue
collar community.  However corruped God's Pocket retains it
sense of identity.</p>
<p> When it loses this focus it loses it soul.  The
actual ending in the trailer park is interesting as it suggests a
sort of idea:  that the only movement possible is to find a 'way
out'.  Perhaps somewhere like Florida where they have a benign
proactive gun laws.</p>
