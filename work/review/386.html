<p><span>Gone
Girl David Fincher (USA 2014);screenplay by Gilllian Flynn from her own
novel Rosamund Pike;Ben Affleck</span></p>
<p><span>Viewed:
Empire Cinema 14 Oct 2014; ticket £3.50</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>From
princess to psychopath – a contemporary fable </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>These
Hollywood ‘relationship’ flicks always try to promote themselves as offering a
new lamps for old deal on the nature of relations. But the movie’s claim on our
attention though strong on lofty purpose: “Gone girl unearths the secrets at
the heart of a modern marriage”is, as
is generally the case, no more than a modesty patch covering up the frenzied
murderous Valkyrie-esque ride of the script, which celebrates modern
psychopathic woman as: the winner.Welcome to the new domestic CEO.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>As
do all the American suburban dwellings in Hollywood movies, the Dunns’ abode
looks like a Doll’s House. (it’s interesting that the script incorporates the
characteristic feature of a stage set, its insubstantial wobbly quality, to ‘prove’
the nature of the supposed assault on Amy)The Dunn’s place doesn’t looked lived in which is of course how its
meant to look, a sort of idealised setting for action.But the Doll’s House look reminded me of
Ibsen’s play, A Dolls House which also explored marriage as a mutual fantasy of
misunderstanding. So no change here: from
19th to 21st century marriage has always had the
potential of being a Gorgon’s head of bad sex murderous intention and
oppression.It’s just today the gender
and role mix is stitched up differently.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Ibsen’s
marital drama was naturalistic in form, Fincher/ Flynn’s movie ( I haven’t read
the book) is of course fantastical. I
wondered if it is actually about marriage?Perhaps it’s real focus is some place else but it uses the marriage mode
of relationship as an expressive template that disguises another realm of
concern. The Nick role, male
protagonist is drawn out as regular. Not too smart, easily deluded and, unable
to communicate with Amy,his sex life
with her is on a par ‘with masturbation’. So he finds himself some new pussy.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Amy role
is that of the wife. But she is imagined
by the script as a magical realist invention.She’s a mythical sorceress, an over the top mad Hollywood blend of Circe
Medusa Nemesis whose powers are unleashed against eternal perfidy of the male,
in the form of her husband.But is Nick’s
perfidy the actual force that drives Amy to unleash, in parodied form her revenge
upon his unsuspecting person?(Like many
Hollywood movies what makes the rather overlong film watchable is its
referencing and parodying of movies of like genre)</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Sketched
lightly into the open sequences of the movie, which provide some back story, (possibly
more detailed in Flynn’s novel) is the
idea that Amy is a modern ‘princess’.That is to say she has had the fairy tale
status of ‘princess’ bestowed upon her by her family.In Amy’s case her parents exploited their
vision of her ‘specialness’ by writing a series of books idealising her childhood.‘Amy-Princess’ growing up in a charmed aura turns
into ‘Amy-Psychopath’.She becomes a
jealous idol that demands, that the adulation ofher perfected attributes that defined her as
a little girl, be extended into her adulthood </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Film
and book are called: Gone Girl: not Gone Woman. And when Amy returns it is
captioned as Back Girl not Back Woman.Amy as woman is girl not woman, a
child tyrant who demands and does not ask. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Nick’s
infidelity triggers Amy’s latent powers. Like a child she first seeks his
obliteration and destruction.But when
circumstances change her magical realist CEO powers of anticipation
organisation and logistics are directed at what is becomes her preferred goal:
the total domination of Nick.His use as
a sperm provider and ancillary consort, a necessary but controllable element in
the perfect picture of coupledom.Nick
exists to be a prince (frog prince?) along side his princess.Gone Girl then works as parody, turning
upside down the Ibsenesque and twentieth century proposition that marriage
exists for the subjection of women by men.Gillian Flynn shows that in the twenty-first century roles are reversed:
marriage exists for the subjugation of men. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>In its choice of subject matter and best selling
authors as oracles of the Zeitgeist, Hollywood often takes depth soundings of
changes of the collective unconscious.Hence, the Zombie the Visions of Apocalypse
testify to the dark subterranean angst that characterises Western society. It
seems that Amy and Nick’s marriage can also be taken as a wider allegory for
the balance of power between the genders.A balance of power that sees ever more women take the public space. But
despite the assertions of some feminists that such a feminin take over will
lead to the emergence of softer less authoritarian management, the collective
psyche fears that those woman who make their way to the top, will often claw
their way up.It will be women driven by
demons who will succeed the men.They will
be indistinguishable from the men in their cruelty andruthlessness pursuit and grip on power.Men
and women may be different in style and expression, but daddy’s princess will
be as dangerous as mummy’s boy to anyone who gets in their way.</span></p>
