<p>SkyfallSam Mendes (2012UK)Daniel Craig; Judy Dench Javier
Bardem</p>
<p>Viewed: Empire Cinema NewcastleTicket £3.60</p>


<p>Post modernist conceit - in a good way</p>

<p>OK it is James Bond, but rather than Ian Fleming it is Orson
Welles who lurks in the shadows of Skyfall (SF), a film that pays its dues to
cinema rather than literature. </p>

<p>Welles’ filmic genius penetrates the movie at all levels
including its actual title.The
coy revelation of the source of the film’s title, the name Skyfall, carved onto
the gatepost of James Bond’s ancestral Scots home in the last action sequence,
is reminiscent of the Welle’s equally restrained disclosure of the source of
‘Rosebud’ in Kane.Operating at
different levels both reveals serve as pointers to a mysterious past that is
about to be consumed in flames and vanish forever.Names without a trace….</p>

<p>The Shanghai fight sequence in SF that is shot exploiting
the refracted images created and multiplied by the glass surfaces within and
without the structures of Shanghai’s light blazoned skyscrapers, instantly
calls to mind the shoot out sequence in Welles’ Lady from Shanghai.In lady from Shanghai Welles and Rita
Hayworth engage in a lethal gun fight in a Hall of Mirrors.Like the earlier Welles sequence, SF’s
exploitation of a world generated by the interplay of replicated images creates
a destabilisation of identity, a confusion of action and an intensifying of
effect.</p>

<p>Lastly the sequences in the London Underground call up
Welles’ most famous screen role as the Third Man, the master ofVienna’s underground sewer system.Javier Bardems intimacy with the
subterranean and its many doors, recall Welles ample elfin movements in a
similar environment.</p>

<p>As an action movie the scenario of SF has to facilitate the
film’s movement from one set piece situation to another.In SF the 6 set pieces, as in almost
any action film are realised very well.In many action movies the ideas driving










<span>the scenario are simplistically contrived oppositions childishly
conceived and lacking developmental stamina, these action films simply run out
of road.</span>  But holding SF together as it shifts through action are a number of
loosely knit understated psychic strands that locatewhat we see and situate the script in a world characterised
by some sort of meta meaning.</p>

<p>I am not referring to the incest motif linking M and
Silva.In itself this dynamic
works OK as a plot exciter, but it’s crude device and retreads familiar
motivational passageways in many movies.The key feature of the script’s play on the incest idea, is that it does
not work alone as an isolated gimmick; rather it is part of the film’s
incalling of allegorical motifs that drive its narrative between the action
scenes and sustain audiences’ engrossment in outcome.</p>

<p>A film franchise that counts 50 years of existence can only
do so by constant reinvention of itself in terms of the signifiers it deploys
and the significations to which it points.</p>

<p>James Bond started filmic life (Dr No) as a lifestyle agent
whose persona was attached to a series of desirable consumer products.Aspirational signifiers were carefully
inculcated into Bond’s Scots Britishness.SF has moved away completely from this. Unlike some
contemporary US products of the action genre which seem little more than
advertising billboards for the products of corporate USA, Bond and Skyfall
avoid product placement. (symbolically perhaps we see the famous Aston Marin
destroyed) The place that Bond is occupies now is very different world from the
world of Fleming where he started,. The product consuming British agent has elided first into a
superhero charged with saving the world, and now, in Skyfall has again moved on
to something quite different.In
Skyfall JB has morphed into a spirit entity, a phantom being from the Land of
the Dead.We can see this most
directly in Bond’s face: at this stage of his incarnation as JB, Daniel Craig
has very very old looking eyes: there is no doubt that he is an old soul. As
indeed is Judy Dench (Admittedly she is old, but…Central Casting could have
fixed that had they wanted.)</p>

<p>Not in its scripted dialogue but in its filmic realisation,
SF has something of the patina of a Gothic horror movie, perhaps an
undead/zombie sort of horror movie (in a good way).The the locations and the settings all suggest that the
action is taking place in a world that is not of the living. The first
pre-title action sequence takes place in daylight mostly, except for the
tunnels, but thereafter the film mostly moves into night or places abandoned by
the living orsubterranean
locations, the haunts of the undead.A Gothic sensibility pervades the mis en scene.This is not only a fashionable make
over, but gives the internal movement of the film coherence and an integrity of
logic.The new displaced MI6HQ,is an old vaulted castle with JB, like Dracula about to be
sent forth into the world of daylight; the Shanghai sequence a phastasorama of
ghostly apparitions; Silva’s city of the dead; the London underground with its
denizens of commuter zombies and the final stand-off at the haunted mansion
which ends in flames and destruction. (A nod to Mandalay in Hitchcock’s
Rebecca) SF is caste in Gothic form, located in Gothic space with a hero from
the shadows of anancient vanished
civilisation that exists only in myth and the old stories.</p>

<p>Britain and Bond have shifted and gone through a time warp
in SF.The forces in play have
changed.At the start of the
50 year journey (Dr No) JB and GBwere both part of an actual world, engaging with specific forces that
could be located in that world.In
SF, neither are part of the actual world: they are both relegated to the lower
nether regions and can only act as phantoms involved in the psychodrama of
their own internecine struggles.But their confidence in themselves is retained. Their maintained self
belief, although ridiculous, is unaffected by their change of status from
living to dead.</p>

<p>In SF JB is transposed to Gothic underworld as an agent of
the dead charged with being the elemental psychic link between the mother son’s
incestual cathexis.</p>

<p>Whilst signifying content and signification may have
changed, a key element of franchise has not altered: the style of the actors’
engagement with content. The persona James Bond has always been a detached
entity denotating and affecting a wry amusement both at self and at the
world:even a world that is
falling to pieces.The Bond
franchise has stayed true to its distancing of itself from itself. </p>

<p>This detachment, the ability of the Bond movies to keep
values and outcomes in this perspective is one reason for its longevity.The Bond films never engage with fear
as a state of mind.In
this they contrast with US franchise vehicles such as Batman which with their
committed stance in relation to specifically American values, build their films
about arousing fear as a state of mind in relation to the threats perceived in
the world of these values being ATTACKED. The value attached to these values is
so great that any sacrifice, even theDESTRUCTIONof the whole
world is preferred to the loss of these values that they hold so dear. This
inclination gives US superhero films a bias towards apocalyptic endings, as in
the 2012 Batman vehicle where the whole of New York is destroyed but the value
of freedom is upheld and maintained.The question arises as to whether the repetition of such committed
apocalypse scenarios can maintain the Batman franchise as long as he detached
Bond model. Or perhaps the outings of the Batman series will have to be
constrictively rationed.</p>
