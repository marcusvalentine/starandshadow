<p>RanAkira
Kurosawa(Japan 1985) Tatsuya
Nakadal; Mieko Harada</p>
<p>Viewed Star and Shadow Cinema 17 June 2012; Ticket £5.00</p>

<p>Ran meaning: riot - uprising - disorder; disturbed -
confused</p>

<p>Ran is a masterful exercise by AKin synthesisingculturally opposing expressive forces in the exposition of his
theme.Ran is riotous filmic
feast in which traditional Japanese plastic arts are promiscuously are
entangled with Hollywood’s;in
larger writ plastic values ofUS
and Japanese society and culture are seamlessly interwoven.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ran’s confusion of stylistic and expressive affects
structures the core underlying motif: a statement by AK about the
disintegrative effects caused by the penetration of American values and
practice into Japanese culture.A
culture no longer protected by self policed isolation; a society and culture in
turmoil but inventive and creative enough, to absorb and replicate on its own
terms, to reinvent itself as a hybrid.</p>

<p>Ran (R) is a conscious play on form, a confusion of genre
and expression.It is a triumphant
mangling of Hollywood and Japan a sort of filmically structured paean to post
war cultural buggery. Ran is witness to AK’s self evident delight in shuffling
together: samurai and cowboy; ‘NOH’ acting tradition and US daytime soap convention; classical Shakespeare and
Hollywood; the mobile and the immobile, the vertical and the horizontal.</p>

<p>The large set piece battles are majestically staged but the
form of the battles strongly suggests John Ford.As the army of the King’s son charges on horse and
foot across the field it is ambushed by devastating volleys of raking firearm
fire decimating the attackers. The opposition of sword spear and bow and arrow
against the gun, suddenly re-casts the battle as the traditional Hollywood spectacle
pitching primitively armed Native Americans (Red Indians) against the superior
arms of the US cavalry with their Colts and Springfields.The clash of the Samurai warriors
instead of being represented as a traditional sword/spear based ritual, is filmed
as a Hollywood slaughter vehicle, a massacre ensuant on the mismatch of unequal
forces.The battles in Ran don’t
pander to traditional notions of the Japanese Samurai Code.Death strikes anonymously without
honour from a distance.When the
cowboy shoots the lesser armed Sioux or Cheyanne, the gun acts as more than a
tool. It is also a valedator.Its
technological supremacy legitimises the victory of the White Man’s culture.In the same way, atomic weapon
technology justified American cultural supremacy.</p>

<p>In Ran AK also exploits the dynamic and expressive
possibilities of intermixing two styles of acting tradition whichdraw on very different formal
expressive ideas and tradition.Noh tradition: the use of the mask, little or no facial expression; this
is not a theatre of expressive faciality, rather of codified gesture where hand
and body combine to create a system of signed meanings.The American soap style in contrast
emphasises the face as the expressive medium, with full use of eyes mouth lips
and teeth used to convey the required emotion.The signage in soap is mostly primary animalistic response,
like a dog bearing its fangs you don’t need to be conversant with a code of
cultural signs to get the meaning.Likewise the delivery of lines is emotively charged to convey
unambiguous intent, even if the words are not explicitly understood.In the playing of characters such
as Lord Hidetora and Lady Kaede, AK synthetically fuses these two opposing
acting styles.The affect is an
intensification of tension between the mobile and the immobile.The audience is caught suspended in
anticipation of the character’s response: whether it be control or loss of
control.Lady Kaede initially is
all mask, a complex of archaic gestural signage, every movement initiated out
of the depths oftheatric
stillness.In one sinewy
terrifying moment like a snake pouncing she is at the throat of her brother in
law and suddenly all Noh convention is completely abandoned and like a suburban
housewife contorting her face she screams at her brother in law to marry her
and bring her the head of his wife.Lady Kaede then with equal suddenness switches back to the still Noh
mode of expressive presentation.</p>

<p>Ran is sometimes described as a Japanese version of King
Lear.Ran is not pure as a
narrative form.AK as part of a
culture that traditionally has purity of form at its core, abandons this idea
in Ran, and has recourse to the Hollywood idea of adaptation of the material: stripping
the scenario down to a simple base line. Ran’s story is a conflation of Macbeth
(with which K was very familiar) and a Lear type story, with sons substituted
for daughters.Two ideas welded
together: the conceit of power that is unable to see behind the formulaic
countenance of love, behind which lurk simmering contempt and desire to usurp;
and the mythic disaster caused by a weak usurper unable to resist the
destructive forces of the feminine.</p>

<p>Fire seems to
me to be the defining filmic element of Ran.Visually it periodically intrudes and finally dominates the
visual field.In the first
sections of Ran AK’s fills frame with horizontal movement.Bautifully staged pans, the flow of
horses and people through and across frame.This is movement that in all its magnificence suggests
continuities, as if it were the template of a timeline.In the final sequences but also
intermittently through the final sections,‘fire’ fills frame vertically.Cutting in disrupting on the vertical axis the easy harmony
of flow.AK has structured
into the visual syntax of Ran the core notion of disruption; time itself is
subject to being broken, its flow smashed up, disrupted.This idea built into the grain of Ran
is the deepest level of communion with his times as AK understands them.</p>
