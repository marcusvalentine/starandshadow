<p>Happy End     Michael
Haneka (2017; Europe)  Isabelle
Huppert;  J-L Trintignant</p>
<p>viewed Tyneside Cinema Newcastle 5th Dec 2017;
ticket: £ 9.75</p>

<p>The Medium is the Message</p>

<p>Haneka’s film has a strange title.  As far as I can tell he has used this title
right across Europe, without translation. 
Usually his film titles are translated. 
But what is the title pointing to? 
Perhaps it’s being at the happy end of the IPhone.  </p>

<p>Haneka’s movie opens and closes with footage taken by Eve on
her IPhone and registers in the projection of the film as ‘IPhone’ footage.  In the first shot she describes what she sees
filming her mother’s bed time routine.  Although Haneka scripted and ‘shot’ these
clips, there is a sense in which they are not his or rather he cannot claim
complete ownership of them.   </p>

<p>Smart phone technology has triggered a culture which is
flooded out by pics and clips.  Dying
fucking eating suicide are grist to the smart phone mill.  Secret ‘shared’ thoughts breakdowns intimacy
the body: what was once considered ‘private’ now is  subject to public broadcaste&hellip; There is sense
in which smart phone recordings can be understood as generic, not in  a meaningful sense owned by anyone but just
part of the milieu in which we live, the water in which we swim.  It is the medium that has become the message.
 </p>

<p>  McLuhan’s vivid
insight, is explored by Haneka through both Eve and then through her father
Thomas.  Through Eve we can see the
effect of cool smart phone technology on her relationship with the world.  Filming on a smart phone she reduces what she
sees to objects of a detached curiosity. 
Filming and on-line media engage a world that is characterised by
fragmentations  discontinuities
disconnections and detachment.   Subjected to the process of continuous
recording, the technology is absorbed into everyone’s psychic reality, it
becomes part of who we all are.  </p>

<p> The smart phone is a
cool technology that mediates its objects as the subjects of a detached
gaze.  It is a gaze that has all the heat
of meaning abstracted and  lacks emotional
consequentiality.    In  ‘Happy End’ Haneka draws on and depicts what
is generic in the culture to depict the depersonalisation of relations in the
film: the relations between father – daughter, mother- son, and the impotent isolation
of George, the pater familias, the old grand-dad.</p>

<p>Whereas Eve’s world is located in the cool detachment of
smart phone technology, Thomas is in thrall to the hot print of internet e-relations.  The heat of the texted instantaneous feed
back loops between him and  Clair, have
reduced them both to an genito-anal infantile fixation.  Whilst Thomas invests in his image (even if it
is in self deception)  Eve in contrast distances
herself from image.  The hot cool
relationship between father and daughter is mirrored in the hot cool relations
between son and mother. Their relationship is introduced by Haneka with CCTV
footage of a construction site accident.     </p>

<p>CCTV material is impersonal fixed image which has a
purported objectivity but may  have
multiple implications.  The accident
triggers the dynamics that cause the split in the Anne and Pierre’s
relationship.  It reinforces and
motivates Anne to take the cool analytic corporate line:  to do whatever is necessary to save the
business.  Whereas Pierre is shocked by
the accident and the harm his firm has caused to an individual,  rejects the legal machinations and embraces
the hot world of emotional responsibility. 
</p>
<p>In one long durational shot, a sort of ‘Pieta’ set up,  Haneka affectively compresses the son /mother
relationship as Anne visits her son Pierre in his room after he has failed to
turn up for work. After a period of immobility, with camera focusing on Peter
stretched half naked on his bed, the camera tracks and pans following the
action, of mother and son stitching the all the dynamics of their changed
relationship together as one statement.   In contrast George, the pater familias,  isolated from the crossed wires of the
intergenerational tensions of his children and grand-children, has nothing left
to do but to die. There is no place left for him in the world. He is not in the
movie.</p>

<p>Haneka seems to me primarily a satirist, working the dark
veins of didactic representation in the manner of a Dean Swift.  His satire works best when it is undeviating
and delivered at face value.   Happy End takes
up the moral theme that has driven Haneka’s directorial career: the bankrupt
and morally degenerate nature of bourgeois consumer society.  Happy End pays homage both in script and
shooting style to Haneka’s previous movies.  
In revisiting particular settings and subjects we see the shadows and
hear echoes of: The Piano Teacher; Funny Games, Hidden, and l’ Amour.  </p>

<p>And this is the problem with the film: it attempts to cover
too much ground.  Haneka’s decision to
reprise elements of Hidden and Piano Teacher don’t work effectively.  The refugee scenes and the actual appearance
of Clair who we know of through her on-line psycho-sexual tryst with
Thomas,  both look like they have been
bolted onto the body of the film. They are both essentially outside the
satirical unfolding of film’s logics, bulking out the body of the film with
topical but specious material.  The
penultimate scene depicting  a hyper
enervated Pierre inviting immigrants to his mother’s wedding feast comes across
simply as a failed homage to Bunuel’s Viridiana.  It is cursory and undeveloped, as is the
appearance of Clair at George’s party: token gestures.   </p>

<p>Happy End is uneven but it is a film of European sensibility.
It encodes, in content and process the idea that we have to interpret what we
see.  We can never see the complete
picture.  Haneka does not generally make
films that comprise only the simplistic images of the Hollywood Cinema. After
our intensive socialisation  through the
symbolic language of  the advertising
industry,  Hollywood feeds us with images
that we simply have to read.  Like
hamburgers we chew them up and swallow them whole. But in the European vein,
Haneka gives us shots that we have to interpret; shots that are detached from
the lexicons of product manipulation; shots that we have to look at and to
decipher in relation to what we know, both from the film and from life.  Happy End is a film that we have to
interpret.</p>
