<p>La La LandDamien
Chazelle (USA 2016)Ryan Gosling, Emma
Stone</p>
<p>viewed 18th Jan 2017 Empire Cinema Newcastle;
ticket: £3.95</p>

<p>follow the dream follow the money</p>

<p>Damien Chazelle’s La La Land (LLL) didn’t register with me a
musical.Rather it was a romcom movie with very ordinary dance routines and some
immemorable songs, bolted on.</p>

<p>What was most interesting was its pitch. What’s it selling? In a similar way to
Aronofsi’s Black Swan, it’s selling Narcissism.The pitch is the legitimation of self engrossment.LLL is an ad, one of those singing dancing
life style promoting adverts wrapped up in a Romantic geste.</p>

<p>Of course this is what makes LLL an interesting mass product
tuned into its times audience and culture; no more relevant than a hair conditioner or a Porsche
promotion, but of a different cultural weight in that it is not selling a
tangible product through narcissistic association, rather narcissism itself is
sold as the intangible product. As community
and family as a source of identity are replaced by commercially factored
indicators of presented individuality, image and self image become core
components of defining self.</p>

<p>Of course evangelical politics and fundamental religions (as
Isis know) can reterritorialise voided selves. But aside from these radical
identity shifts, in the West it is the mix of music social media movies and adverts
that define and reflect self image.Cue
LA LA Land which, like ‘the Black Swan’, is primarily aimed at the manipulation
of its female audience.</p>

<p>The way LLL is shot is reminiscent of a two hour selfie with
the iPhone pointed at Mia.The camera
loves Mia, its lens caresses her and whenever it gets the chance, it zooms in for a kiss, tracking in for that Big
Close Up of her happy smiley face.Mia’s
face, or perhaps a faciality Mia’s implied affective state that comes to
exemplify the ‘Dream’;not just any
dream but the ultimate defining dream that everything is possible.Just pursue your dream: everything you desire
will be yours.In her exemplary
mediocrity, Mia in herself epitomises this for her audience, in that Emma Stone’s execution of the
specifically technical demands of the film is very ordinary.Neither her singing nor her dancing are
particularly good.This in itself is
important; it flags up the message to the audience about the levelling out of
their own aspirations.LLL says to its
adoring public that it doesn’t matter if you can’t do stuff very well, there’s
no need to spend too much time on proficiency; just trying reasonably hard is enough to fulfil
your dream.Mia is a simple uncomplicated
undemanding role model.</p>

<p>Sebastian interestingly is not.It feels as if Chazelle has scripted him not
as a boyfriend but an animus: Mia’s
psychic shadow, the unstated repressed elements of her being.Sebastian, as Chazelle sets him up, comes
across as so contradictory that even the LLL script gives up trying to
understand or develop him coherently.For
instance, Sebastian claims to love jazz; but when he plays the piano for
himself, he gurgitates the La La Land theme music which sounds like a middling
Einaudi composition.Not Jazz.In the end Chazelle’s gives up the pretence that
Sebastian is an independent character, and he is assimilated into Mia’s dream
of perfect romance. Of course he is marginally more interesting as a shadow.</p>

<p>LLL is trailed as a homage re-visiting of the ‘classic
Hollywood musicals.But it is not. The great Hollywood musicals worked through
de-individuation. Minnelli Donen et al created dream worlds into which their
characters were assimilated. In dance the outer forms, the identities and
characters of AstaireKelly Rogers or
Charisse, fell from them as they became
dancers pure released into another world.But these guys could dance; the same cannot be said of Gosling and
Stone.Chazelle, with the exception of
the opening number, has the opposite intention than that implicit in the great
era musicals: that the dance advances individuality. In particular with
Miadance serves her rather than she
serving the dance.As such, given the
low level of performance, the musical numbers are flat rather than
elevating.Even the opening number set
on the upper deck of a highway snarl-up falls victim to the curse of the one shot fetish.The camera movement although fluid always
has a feeling of being ill at ease with itself, of perhaps drawing attention to
itself, its individuality and taking attention away from the dance.There is one moment of energy when the tailgate
of a truck rolls open to reveal a band playing; otherwise this ten minute shot
falls victim to its own mechanics. The less said about the homage shot to ‘American
in Paris’ the better; its not even a pale imitation.The
problem with the choreography and settings of this homage are augmented by the
low calibre musical composition; but Gershwins are thin on the ground these
days. </p>

<p>Of most interest in the development of the film was the end
section of the credits roller. Up and past went an unending series of names of
financial backers and co-production deals (There was significant product
placement in the movie).La La Land has
been an expertly sold prospect to international investors, including the
Chinese.In the era of the soft
machinery, the malleable ego, expect business model clones to follow.</p>
