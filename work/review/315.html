<p>The DictatorLarry Charles, script: Berg and Cohen (USA 2012)Sacha Baron Cohen; Anna Faris; Ben
Kingsley</p>
<p>Viewed: Empire Newcastle upon Tyne29 May 2012; Ticket: £3.50</p>

<p>The Dictator (D) opens with a dedication to Kim Jong ll
issuing a spoof claim that it’s a film that is designed to be a satirical
political vehicle for Sacha Baron Cohen’s (SBC) performance.But it’s not;D is SBC as a vestigial archetype a repository for a
recurring psychic type: the trickster. </p>

<p>D is uninteresting from the point of view of its formal
filmic qualities. As film it simply lurches from one cameo set up to the next,
to drag the plot line through its beginning middle and end.The plot is a rigid mechanical
structure that lacks the fluidity improvisation or relational complexity that
characterise other filmic comedians such as Chaplin, the Marx Brothers or Woody
Allen.D is a crude construct, but
a construct that reflects, in script and performance, the essence of its core
intent: transgression. The eruption of the forbidden and the shocking out of
the shadows into consciousness.</p>

<p>The cinema was
full (it was the Tuesday cheap seat night) and the crowd had come in
expectation of a laugh.But
what constitutes a laugh?SBC is
not a clown.He never really gets
into the shit in any meaningful sense.SBC is the nightmarish emanation arising out of the
tension between the animal and culture: grossly sexual, stupid, and although
not really evil he does the most atrocious things from sheer unconsciousness
and unrelated ness.He is saved by
his almost divine animal nature.SBC’s role is that ofthe
Trickster, the violator, a serial malicious profane transgressor.</p>

<p>Violator of the sacred.</p>

<p>SBC in all his films plays: the Trickster. A psychic figure
who occupies a latent place in our psychic functioning and who spontaneously
manifests in external expressive representational form when the gap between the
stated values, the cant and shibboleths of civilised culture and our own animal
nature, reaches points of extreme tension. </p>

<p>The phantom of the trickster haunts us….a faithful
reflection of an undifferentiated human consciousness that has barely left the
animal level. (Carl Jung: Four Archetypes) </p>

<p>The Trickster manifest is a projection of our needs.</p>

<p>At a time when Western Liberal Culture is characterised by
discourses of quasi religious intensity in respect of: human rights, women’s
rights, individuation, the sanctity of mother family and children: enter the
trickster to hold up to us the reversal and opposing debasement of these
values.To allow us smash through
the tensions of civilisation in the darkness of the cinema.</p>

<p>In the same spirit as in the Medieval church where a
simpleton was elected anti-Bishop during Epiphany and presided over a mass
attended by donkeys where the congregation brayed in liturgical response; so
BSC sticks his hand up the vagina of the mother whom he has just helped give
birth, and retrieves his ringing mobile phone he’s left in her uterus.Both actions stem from the
Trickster role as a mythic archetype:manifest violation of the sacred.And both actions are part of a psychic reaction to a dominant cultural
imperative.They transgress or
reverse carefully defined spacial borders as a radical gestural performance
that is aimed specifically, if temporarily at sabotaging the psychic legitimacy
of the dominant discourse.</p>

<p>D’s main effect is not to be funny but rather to shift
psychic response from the unconscious to the consciously maifest.A cathartic shift that is often
necessitated by an overwhelming of our defences and resistance to the stimulus
of the antics of the tricksterIf D is not by and large actually funny the movie nevertheless educes
laughter from the audience.Laughter that is the expressive ejaculative response that we have
recourse to when we have no other immediate means of release from physical and
emotional tension.</p>

<p>The Trickster’s radical transgression, even in ritual form,
causes a sudden rise in psychic/emotional stresses as we witness a sacred
phenomenon systematicallyassaulted.The releasing outlet for this tension
is laughter; remembering that the rictus of the laugh shares a common
physiological root with the rictus of aggression, which is also consequential
to a sudden rise in unbearable tension.</p>

<p>Tricksters, as mythic characters have very crude natures.
There is no point in expecting subtlety from them.They are physically gross and sexually explicit, their sex
organs prominent and dominant when and where least appropriate as when the
Dictator is taught how to masturbate himself by Zoe the health food store
manager.</p>

<p>The targets of human rights, feminism, United Nations,
democracy, mother and apple pie have no political significance, only a
collective mythic imperative to debase and upend.</p>

<p>Superficially D tries to lay claim to making some form of
political statement.It’s opening
dedication toKim Jong, and in the
penultimate sequence when BSC as the Dictator delivers a speech to UN officials
satirically praising democracy as being the most desirable form of government
because in democracy: 1% of the people own 99% of the wealth, in democracy the
poor pay all the taxes andthe
rich pay none, and in democracy the gaols can be full of specific poor ethnic
grouping.I think the claim to be
a political satire is spurious.SBC’s delivery of his UN speech is the weakest part of his performance,
as if he realised the speech/diatribe was of course undermined by the nature
ofhis role as Trickster.In this sequence SBC’s delivery seems
mechanical formulaic and underplayed.It’s not political rather the weakest part of the Tricksters repertoire
of transgression.</p>

<p>SBC inperformance has strong representational qualities kin to the
Trickster.The beard and the
thinness of his body both play a part in suggesting a manifestation from the
depths. The beard (and its loss) is a wondrous cheap device perfect for the
guise of trickster and SBC’s thinness has a menace such that although a tall
man he’s thin enough to slip inside your defences and unbalance you; slim
enough to slip inside your urethra. And SBC’s delivery has a quality of the
ventriloquist’s dummy, the removed insinuating of a wicket schoolboy automaton.</p>

<p>According to
Jung The Trickster is a vestigial figure surviving from a barbarous
consciousnessof aqn early phase
of human consciouness: a collective shadow figure.As architype the Trickser remains pyschically close to us
often revealing his presence in popular culture.He can be repressed but never goes away, never entrirely
absent from our collective life. </p>
