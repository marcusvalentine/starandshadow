<p><span>Der Mude Tod ( Destiny)Fritz Lang (1921; Germany; script by FL and Thea von
Harbou)Lil Dagover; Bernhard Goetze </span></p>
<p><span>viewed 11 June 2017 Tyneside Cinema; ticket:
£9.75</span></p>
<p><span>depth of tread</span></p>
<p><span>There is a shot in der Mude Tod that
concentrates into one image the psychic forces that Lang’s movie puts into play:
the shot of the Wall.The devils’s Wall.The
Wall is shot straight on from 90 degrees.It rises above and beyond all who stand beneath it a presence that
overwhelms those who come within its ambit. The Wall is a cosmic abstraction
that divides the known from the unknown, a wall found only in thedream.</span></p>
<p><span>The Wall is of course an archetype,one in a movie that is contrived only out of archetypal
forms and presences.Der Mude Tod is a
visitation from the landscape of myth and fairy tale.The Wall has been built by Death to mark off
his world from the world of the living and the man at the crossroads represents
the other enduring archetypal image about which the film revolves.Death played by Bernard Goetze, whose extraordinary
representation of the grim reaper calls to mind Ben Ekerot’sas Death in Bergman’s Seventh Seal,both dark personifications of the eternal
riddle.Both haunting and unforgettable.</span></p>
<p><span>Seeing Lang’s film was a strong reminder that
the silent movie era worked strongly with archetypes to create characters and
narratives. Both Hollywood and German silent cinema contrived narratives out of
types: the lover, the liar, the warrior, the seeker, the hero, the beloved, the
tramp, the lost, the wanderer.Silent
movie scripts fashioned their material out of the stuff of dreams and
myth.The characters in one dynamic
sense were free, they were free from history and individuation.But unfree in another sense in that they were
bound the more tightly to their form and constrained by fateful outcomes. In ‘silent
movie’ scripts people tended to be found in ‘situations’ and then use their
immediate resources to work their way out.Resources might be within them or outside of themselves, like allies that as in fairy tales might come
in unexpected guise. Unlike modern
scripts archetypal characters are not contrived from personal histories or
subjectivities that lay claim to them and to their development. </span></p>
<p><span>The compliance to archetypal form by
fictitious characters, although delimiting in some respects, in a critical
manner allows character to develop through lines of flight, intensifications
and testings, rather than the playing out and development of the will of
individuals.The idea of the primacy of
the individual’s will in determining their lives is the ideological key stone
of most late 20th century and all 21st century dramatic
output, in particular cinema.The
scripted imperatives are to realise your dreams, to buy what you need and to
discover your individuation to attain your goals.Film today has little time for archetypes
whose defining quality is their inability to be anything other than they
are.</span></p>
<p><span>And yet the archetype is a powerful and
suggestive idea.Whereas it does not use
subjective intention and individuation as a determining agency it brings into
play the development of other psychic possibilities endemic to human
experience. We are all types.The roles we play as part of the being of a
type exert a strong hold over our psyche.Being a mother being a father have fateful consequences for our being in
the world.They are in themselves a
guide to responding to life.In life
and in drama:the seeker, the lover, the
warrior, the loser, the orphan as represented by a person can be put to the
test to the point of destruction, yet still be shaped and held together by the
psychic force of the archetype that they embody.</span></p>
<p><span>This is evident in the scripting in der Mude
Tod, of the female half of the loving couple.This female type calls on exclusively feminine traits to pursue her
objective: her re-union with her male half.She is a feminine heroine who calls on the claims of love, faithfulness and steadfastness and the power
of love projected to try to win back her male half from Death’s kingdom.The female in her is brave bold and conquers
her fear, drawing on feminine qualities.
Unlike most of today’s contemporary
women leads, Lang’s heroine is not a transposed man, she is a woman and she
works towards her goal by an process of intensification of her female
qualities, not by denying them or abandoning them for male characteristics. </span></p>
<p><span>Lang’s Der Mude Tod (MT) is a strong visual
reminder of what film could look like before the digital hegemony.The film’s images look as if they etched into
screen rather than overlaid.Most of
todays films have the look of a flat plane.Even where they are shot and exhibited in 3D, the 3D effect simply
resembles a series of multiple planes.But Lang’s movie like a Durer woodcut, draws us in beyond the surface
into spacial and psychological depth. The faces, the archetypal figures pressed
into the celluloid, the extraordinary architecture, like the etchings from
fairy tale collections,Mude Tod is visually
burnt into tonal layers that create unfathomable depth suggesting immanent but unseen
powers.</span></p>
<p><span>With its Gothic visual style knitted tightly
to the other main expressive elements,archetypal
characters, its representation of the face and body and its architecture, Lang
produces a filmthat with its force of
unity resembles the conviction of any of the Grimm’s’ fairy tales.Indeed Mude Tod in its subtitle references itself
as a German folk tale. Lang’s film like
the fairy tale, is a film of darkness but in this darkness we come to
understand more deeply the defining qualities of the human realm. Adrin Neatrouradrinuk@yahoo.co.uk</span></p>
