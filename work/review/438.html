<p>PatersonJim Jarmusch (USA 2016)Adam Driver, Golshifteh Farahaniviewed: Tyneside Cinema 7th Dec
2016: ticket £9.25</p>

<p>Kup Cake Land</p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Paterson
is a New Jersey town, a half hour drive from New York City that was at the
heart of the industrialisation of the USA.Important developments in mechanical looms, industrial lathes and guns were
made here.The industrial legacy has
been omitted from the film which focuses on how the baking of celebrity
kup-cakes is replacing poetry by way of celebrating the existence of Paterson.</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span>‘Paterson’,
fronted by its eponymous lead character Paterson (Adam Driver), is Jamusch’s paean
to William Carlos Williams, poet and doctor who lived and practiced in
Paterson. Williams’ work, one book of which is called Paterson is often about
Paterson. Williams maps out the contours
of the ordinary and everyday in a manner that in part takes a lead from
Japanese poetry, in particular the form of the haiku, short poetic pieces
energised by surprise in antithesis. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Viewing
Jarmusch’s ‘Paterson’ raises the question as to whether the verbal imagery and
signage of poetry can be meaningfully transposed to the graphic image of
film.</span></p>
<p><span>Jarmusch
seems to attempt this both in structure of the movie and in the composition of
some of his shots.In relation to the
latter, Jarmusch uses some shots to try and render something of the sort of
casual intense observation characterising Williams’ work.As when the camera at the end of a shot or a
sequence comes to rest at or points at a pile of black trash bags or looks down
from the point of view of Paterson, into the glass of a half drunk beer.The issue with these shots is that they come
across as arbitrary rather than meaningful,denoting a script that struggles to rise aboveformulaic cinematic translation.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Jarmusch
structures ‘Paterson’ in a manner that is sympathetic to the way in which Williams
sees the world, building in repetitions of the everyday as a poetic
motif.After the opening sequences Jarmusch
establishes ‘Paterson’ as a diurnal structure, subtitles burning in the day of
the week.The film takes us from one
Monday morning through to the following Monday morning with the action taking
place within the unfolding of everyday: the getting up, the eating breakfast,
the walk to work, the work place, the bus driving.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>I
think that what a poet like William Carlos Williams sees is in a critical
respect, under the surface of the image.His thought, a teasing attuned intelligence, uncovers aspects in
life.What Jarmusch as the film maker sees,
is on the surface.Williams mannered
deliberated expression works as it fuses insight and image.Jarmusch’s mannered deliberate film making
stays on the surface of life; unable to penetrate substance,‘Paterson’ becomes an exercise in the stylised
rendering of the material.Anod and genuflection in Williams’ direction. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>I
think this is exemplified by the first poem used in the film.The words are spoken and superimposed over
the picture of it being written by Paterson as he waits to take his bus out of
the depot.The first line is:“We
have plenty of matches in our house…”The poem describes a brand of matches and connects them to the love of
his life. The problem is that no one in the movie, certainly not Laura or
Paterson, uses matches.For Willaim
Carlos Williams they would have been part of the fabric of life. And, for this
reason matches might have given him pause. In ‘Paterson’ no one smokes, no one lights
candles, the hobs don’t need candles.No
one uses matches.Matches are not part
of life.They are consigned to a past. The suspicion is that they are subject of
Paterson’s poetry because they have a ‘cute’ value as a stylistic
appropriation. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>The
misfit between style and content becomes the more manifest as Jarmusch develops
the character and role of Laura, who increasingly takes centre stage in the
action.Laura, a character perhaps
inspired by 1950’s TV sitcom, ‘I Love Lucy’, or a sort of updated Annie Hall
type, increasingly dominates the movie,transforming ‘Paterson’ into an aesthetic stylised expression of
suburban life.Introduced first on the
conjugal bed in an overhead shot, as a sensually posed (Japanese style)
composition of black flowing hair, patterned fabric and skin.From here, Laura slowly expands into ‘Paterson’.With her obsession for black and white
motifs, her energy finally colonises the movie.By the time we arrive at the Kup Cake bake
her stylised aesthetic has crowded out
all the other strands of the movie.‘Paterson’
recedes further into the grey as the world of the everyday is overwhelmed by Laura’s
cult of can-do celebrity. The social forces retreat against the onslaught of
unbridled individuality. William Carlos
Williams is Kup-Caked.And in the
kup-cakes, ‘Paterson’ becomes a celebration of pure contemporary Americana, a
celebration of the vacuousness of individuation.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>So
Jarmusch’s ‘Paterson’ turns out as allegory of these times of Trump. Old style poetry and seeing the truefade out and the venal mendacity of reality
TV increases its vice grip on the psyche of America.She who shouts loudest wins.</span></p>
