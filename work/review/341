In oneiric opening scenes shown in fragmented sequence, we become
acquainted with Walker, a man wronged and left for dead on Alcatraz
Island after a heist-gone-awry. His share was supposed to be $93,000
but old pal Mal Reese took it all to pay off the considerable debt he
owes to shady crime syndicate the Organization, as well as Walker's
wife Lynn. But now after somehow escaping the inescapable fortress, the
big guy's out on the warpath. Only it's not for revenge, he "just
really want[s] his money". And with a little help from a seemingly
all-knowing man known only as Yost, he sets about rattling the cage of
the criminal overworld for his meagre sum.I say overworld because in Great Society era California, the criminals
wear suits and ties, occupy penthouse suites and corporate boardrooms.
There is no mob boss at the top of it all, just endless layers of
bureaucracy. The women no longer suggest sexuality with arched eyebrows
and make-up but rather flaunt it in miniskirts and revealing dresses.
The smoke-filled bars of yesteryear are now desegregated jazz clubs,
havens for downtown businessmen hungry for a taste of the
counter-culture. Many consider the film to be the first in this
neo-noir style, where the old rules were revised for the post-Hays code
generation.However, the rules were not only being rewritten for Hollywood but for
all of America. Never had the country suffered so woefully from this
crippling uncertainty regarding its continued existence since the Civil
War one hundred years earlier. The convertibility of the dollar to gold
under the Bretton Woods system was strained by the undeclared Vietnam
War and LBJ's domestic programs. Martin Luther King's warning that "a
nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military
defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual
doom" went unheeded, as evidenced by the spiritually dead character of
Walker.For actor Lee Marvin, the role was very much a reflection on his
dehumanizing experience of the Pacific theater in World War Two, which
director John Boorman and Marvin would return to again one year later
in <i>Hell in the Pacific</i>. However, <i>Point Blank</i> is commonly considered
to be a ghost story of sorts, with Walker haunting his enemies in a
seemingly unreal afterlife. He never kills his victims or f*cks his
women, contrary to the tagline's promise. Reese is spooked out onto the
balcony of his penthouse suite where he falls to his death and Carter
stumbles out onto the LA river culvert where a sniper mistakes him for
our antihero. The only time he fires his gun is when pumping hot lead
into the sheets of his ex-wife's Lynne's bed, spending his sexual
energy in the masturbatory search for Reese. Boorman admits to letting Marvin effectively un-write his only scene of
dialogue with Sharon Acker's Lynn wherein he originally interrogated
her, preferring instead to sit in stony silence while she guiltily
spills forth the beans on her relationship with Reese before OD'ing on
pills without any provocation on Walker's behalf. Later, when his
ex-sister-in-law Chris (played by Angie Dickinson) beats his chest with
futility he stands stoically, not taking it â€“just not responding, and
then slides into his armchair where he watches TV. After 'killing' his way up the seemingly never-ending Organization
hierarchy, he is once again tipped off by that ubiquitous Yost
(portrayed eerily by Keenan Wynn). This time it leads him to Brewster,
the man below Fairfax who can get Walker his $93K. So he returns to
Alcatraz for closure, watching over Brewster who brings a briefcase in
which he claims is the money. Walker remains in the shadows when
Brewster is shot by a sniper. Yost then emerges from the shadows for a
dying Brewster to call him out as Fairfax but Walker still doesn't
budge. Finally the sniper descends from his shadow-enshrouded position
and Yost/Fairfax thanks Walker for eliminating his overly ambitious
underlings and offers him an enforcer job. Walker heeds not the offer
and recedes into the shadows&hellip;By the end, we know not whether the Organization made good on its
promise and paid. It seems it was the ultimate MacGuffin, carrying the
story along to the very end. Viewing the film through the eidolonian
prism, it could be said that the apparition of Walker is fading, losing
its effect and ability to inspire fear and that is perhaps why he never
descends to claim his meagre bounty. His fading away would appear to
infer the expiration of his being. The revenant Walker's objective was
merely to ascertain whether honour still existed among thieves. It
didn't, and neither did their recognition that they were.
