<p>Under the Skin   Jonathan Glazer (UK
2013)  Scarlett Johansson</p>
<h4 class="western">Viewed:  Tyneside
Cinema, 25 March 2014;  Ticket: £8.80</h4>
<p>Sort of 20-50 vision</p>
<p>A vampire movie manqué with ETs
playing zombies as slinky Scarlett cast as Laura the unnameable,
po-faces her way through the movie as a white van vamp woman.   After
zeroing a few guys in black sump oil Scarlett finally disintegrates
both mentally and physically, in the traditional way that vamps wilt
in the midday sun. As an successful exercise in vacuity, her death is
hard to beat. 
</p>
<p>Viewing Jonathan Glazer's 'Skin' movie
I saw all the signs of a post-modernist conceit.  It's an art ref
movie drawing primary inspiration from installation art.  'Skin
comprises of a number of cameo sequences that are a series of
spectacles, disconnected events and situations, that are less cinema
more 'walk through'. 
</p>
<p>In so far as it is 'walk through'
spectacle the film is made complete only by the gaze of the audience.
 The gaze and the presented image are one, in the sense that a
firework display as spectacle, must be validated by an  audience.  
Their gaze is directed at and is part of the spectacle, whose
justification is usually not part of its expression;  the viewer
gazes on an abstract expressive form.  Understanding the event for
the audience means referrence to socio-cultural knowledge extrinsic
to the spectacle. For instance, connecting a firework display to the
14th July or Guy Fawkes night.  The gaze has to refer
extrinsically for an events signification,  and is in opposition to
seeing.  
</p>
<p>Seeing connects with immediate effect
to an understanding of what is exposed or revealed.  Seeing involves,
a direct connection with its object; it is an extrapolation of the
self into the experience. 
</p>
<p>Jonathan Glazer's movie exists for the
gaze.  It is a post-modernist exercise in film pointing the viewer to
signifiers outside of itself.  Taking the form of an installation
'Skin' exploits signs symbols and icons drawn from the worlds of art
and populat culure to reference itself.</p>
<p>Watching 'Skin' it looked like the
primary frame of reference for Glazer was the installation works of
Bill Viola and their unity with 'gaze'.</p>
<p>Some recent works of Bill Viola such
as Reflecting Pool or the Crossing, have as the defining feature of
their form, exteriority, and of their content, their Weirdness. 
Viola installations create a situation or an event:   Within these
there is no context other than the setting; the event is self
contained;  there is neither  explanation nor engaged emotion.  Gaze
is confronted with 'the Weird.' The works are beautifully fabricated
and both these cases involve 'wetness'. 
</p>
<p>Viola as artist provides a similar
spectacle for the gaze (stripped of justifying mumbo jumbo) to that
given by Spiritualist performers of the nineteenth century, such as
the Fox sisters.   This form of Spiritualism was always a performance
event, an 'installation' even.   But in Viola's work,  an 'Art'
belief system rather than 'After-life' belief system, is the 'Frame'.
 Viola's 21st century water spectacles are a sort of
transposed 19th century ectoplasm,  and as with those strange
photographs of 19th century Spiritualism,  images capture
gaze.  With the Crossing and the Reflecting Pool,  Bill Viola
suggests a notion of 'life' that stretches beyond the rational into a
metaphysical realm, a realm that can be claimed for 'Art'.   The
which claim,  just like the performances of spiritualists, provides
comfort of a sort to those seeking such comfort.  For everyone else, 
there remains the aesthetic of fabficating the ineluctable.</p>
<p>Under the Skin, takes its cue from the
metaphysical suggestions implicit in Viola's work.  The form and the
content resonate within the same spheres.   No emotion, self
contained, no context (setting yes in Arbroath area) no meaning other
than 'Art'.  But whereas Viola's work is confined to a single event
or situation, Glazer's movie chews through a multiplicity of events
and situations in his desperate attempt to concoct a scenario. And as
the film lurches on from scene to scene, situation to situation so
the project becomes increasingly  troubled, until the hopelessly
meandering script runs out of road and the decision is taken to put
the thing to death.</p>
<p>If the form of Under the Skin derives
from work by artists such as Bill Viola then its content owes much to
contemporary British art, pop art, referential film iconography and
Ken Campbell’s Science Fiction Theatre of Liverpool.   A derivative
menu of references cobbled together in a stylistic potpourri.</p>
<p>At the core of the film's stylistic
referents is Richard Wilson's seminal sculptural piece 20/50,  one of
the signature pieces of Saatchi's collection.  It is a sculpture that
comprises a large reflecting pool of black sump oil with a viewing
platform that allows viewer to stand directly over it.  Richard
Wilson's idea of a viscous black pool plays a central role in the
'Skin' scenario.  Glazer uses a similar sort of liquid black
ectoplasmic pool into which Laura draws her male prey.  These scenes
of seduction, thrice repeated, comprise the glossy visual centrefold
of Under the Skin: Scarlett's victims lured and entranced  by her
body step down into and then under the overfolding black viscous
substance.  It's a spectacle of implied finality but interestingly it
has a metaphysical afterburn in that the victims don't seem to die
immediately, but something other happens to them.  In the 20/50
version of inverse ectoplasm, the victims seem to deform and
coagulate.  Of course it's  not at all clear what is going on, but
again that's just like those old 19th century photographs.</p>
<p>Also thrown into the 'Skin' plotpot
are Cocteau's motorbike leather angels from Orphee.  And the glaring
white backgrounds via David Bailey from Antonioni's Blow Up (also the
rather arch dialogue spoken by Scarlett was very reminiscent of Sarah
Miles' delivery in Blow Up).  There is also Scorcese's fascination
with night time reflected and refracted light, played out repeatedly
as seen from the interior of the white van.</p>
<p>From the Pop art side there's the
invention of White Van Woman as serial killer. The only problem is
that Scarlett after she's lured her prey into the 20/50 pond, has
nowhere else to go.  
</p>
<p>There is a current fashion in films
with Art pretensions to include a lot of 'meaningful' landscape
shots.  Glazer's 'Skin' is replete with such shots.  When used by film maker Peter Strickland in Katalin Varga landscape does interlock
with the script. But in 'Skin' the use of the forests the seas the
mountains look like polyfilla, just something to toss onto the
timeline to show you're trying to make something of the material.  In
'Skin' the trick does not work.</p>
<p>Lastly the plot, if you can call it
that, has something of the crazed lurching quality that characterised
the sort of plays that Ken Campbell used to put together for the
Science Fiction Theatre of Liverpool. But with live actors the script
was an pretext to present and develop ideas; he tongue in cheek ethos
of the ensemble allowed a fine intermix of farce and serious
propositions. This is hard to achieve in film, and is certainly not
accomplished by 'Skin' . But imagine my surprise at the finale of
Skin, when a dead ringer for the late Ken Campbell appears on screen
as a character in the woods and meets Laura.  Having failed to get
his wellie over, he proceeds to hoy a bucket of petrol over her and
torch the bitch.  Very interesting.  Even if it wasn't that funny.</p>
<p>My reading is that Glazer intended
Under the Skin to be a cool detached referential vehicle for “Art”
with a nod towards the absurd.  It ends up a jumbled farrago of
motifs, less than the sum of its parts, that looks like it has been
rescued somewhere in the cutting room.  The danger is when you have a
project that comprises and hangs on a wide range of source material,
you don't end up with a film, you end up with a vanity project.
