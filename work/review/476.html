<p>The SquareRuben Ostland (2017 Swe)Claes Bang</p>
<p>viewed Tyneside Cinema 22 March 2018; ticket £9.75</p>

<p>So like a selfie</p>

<p>Ruben Ostland’s movie the Square is a perfectly calculated
vehicle for the age of narcissism, our absorption with self image.This is the age of the image, billions and
billions of them, and of this hyper plenitude of images the most significant
are those we make for and of - ourselves.An earlier generation of movie makers most obviously Bresson, Bergman, might
have employed film to probe something of the unseen in man; today’s directors
can procede on the basis that as the unseen gives up no image, so, it can be taken as a given that it
is non existent.Image is all.</p>

<p>Ostland’s protagonist, Christian, is the director of a
leading edge art gallery in Stockholm, XRoyal.He lives by the image and will die by the image.Ostland’s script is crafted about a number of
comic situational set pieces that allow Christian to show that if love is
blind, then self love is locked-in syndrome. A series of interviews
presentations interpolations and a one night stand establish, economically humorously
– perceptively - that ‘me’ and ‘me too’ is the subject at the heart of the post
modernist expression of art.</p>

<p>Christian’s gallerial world envelopes him excluding the
beggars and refugees that proliferate and multiply outside on the streets of
Stockholm, part of the circuitry of small change from which Christian’s
electronic payments have freed him. They are also tangentially related to the
world of trust and caring, defined by idea of the Square, that he has decided
to import as a artist’s concept into the bounded world of the gallery.The Square as concept accords with the key
strictures of ‘Art’ marketing.It has
the specious conceptual quality of seeming to be mean something, when it means
nothing; it is about generating image, an outer symbolic pointing to something
that is not there but can be seen; it is emptied of everything except self
image but as concept as image, draws attention to itself as a gestural performance.</p>

<p>The development of the Square concept as a trust experiment and
its marketing, is beautifully offset by the scene in the bedroom during Christian’s
one night stand. Having fucked the admiring lady he removes his condom and, distrusting
the woman’s motives refuses to hand it over to her for disposal, thinking she
might try a little self fertilisation on the side with his prize A Grade semen.
</p>

<p>Though you might think Christian would want, as his gesture,
to put the condom in the Square or at least use a condom lined with an
effective spermicide. </p>

<p>The trouble with the Ostland’s movie is that it reaches its
natural climax with the explosive YouTube marketing film.Watching the fall out from this debacle seems
to wrap up all the film has to say.But
instead, Ostland, perhaps driven by extra filmic forces, subjects the audience
to another hour of inconsequential footage.Perhaps the idea of the ordeal by embarrassment caused by framing issues
arising from the ape-man’s presence and antics amongst the dinner guests from
the upper tier of Stockholm society, felt too good to drop.But this sort of context framing difficulty
is well covered in film, and in its inconsequentiality added nothing to ‘The
Square’.</p>

<p>But Ostland’s cinematic use of camera frame was an
outstanding feature of both the film’s comic vision and of its filmic
concern.Ostland has a sensitised feel for the
potential of comedic situations and how to exploit them effectively.He understands that the projections of what
is suggested out of frame, used economically and succinctly, is more effective
than what might be shown.But also the
idea of using out of frame events means that Christian himself is held centre
frame. The events from which we are occluded are never as important as
Christian and his reaction. Ostland structures his camera work to accord with
the key motif of his movie.</p>

<p>In ‘The Square’ there is one undisputed moment of sublime performance
artistry.It is joke which to some
extent drives the script.Christian has
his pocket expertly and exquisitely picked by a true delving artist. He is left as naked - bereft of his mobile and
his wallet.Of course he doesn’t see the
art nor get the joke.The problem with
the film is that the joke becomes a shaggy dog story that outlives its battery
life.</p>
