Jenkins (USA 2017) Gal Gadot, Chris Pine

<p>viewed Empire Cinema Newcastle 6 June 2017; ticket £4.00</p>

<p>tweet from Trumpland</p>

<p>At last a super hero film that is the perfect allegorical
representation of our times.In
directing Wonder Woman, Patty Jenkins has produced a mythical scenario that is faithful to President
Trump’s condition and situation.A
situation of isolation from any influences other than his family of Gods and
Goddesses; a condition of paranoia to hold the world at bay.In Wonder Woman the tweets lies and
blandishments of Mr President underlie the movie’s script endowing it with deep
superficiality, with a post truth/ post modernist sentiment and tweets,
disguised as dialogue,with new age
mantras: believe! love! etc!</p>

<p>Like most recent
Hollywood movies Jenkins and her script writers are beholden to the polemics of
fake female empowerment.This is an easy lazy speciously righteous
position to take as it means that the only thinking that has to be done is, is a flip, turning the women into men; rather
than having to figure out what other defining characteristics might constitute
strong female qualities.The Hollywood
solution is that the empowerment of women’s natures is best expressed by them emulating
and surpassing men in the outer expression of sexual power. This equates neatly with the Trump position
as regards women.Looking at the women
with whom Trump surrounds himself, Ivanka, Melania, Kellyanne they all have
that touch of Wonder woman in their expressive genes. Like the models found in
Vogue and Vanity Fair, they comprise a
legion of woman defined by images of a warrior sexuality, as they threaten to
break forth out of the pages of fashion glossies into the heat of battle.A new era of female soldiery dressed to kill confident of victory against whatever forces
they might meet: men, cellulose, other women, unruly hair.</p>

<p>Mythically Trump of course has Zeus like qualities.From his tower eyrie high he presides over
the earthlings, figuring out their comings and goings.Alone at the top of Olympus, he’s a God increasingly
isolated and reliant on Wonder Woman, Ivanka to represent him to the world
beyond, to fight off the forces of evil by which he imagines himself
surrounded.Go forth Wonder Woman and save
the world for America, go forth Ivanka and make America great again.And so
they go forth into the world.</p>

<p>Judging by the plot and to some extent the visual look of
the film Jenkins has spent some time looking at the work of Tarantino.In particular Inglorious Basterds must have
caught her attention.Tarantino’s commercially
successful post modernist trystmarried
film to an assemblage of fake history coined out of second world war material.</p>

<p>Inglorious Basterds is Tarantino’s affirmation that the world,
and all it contains, should be subsumed to the movie.Cinema should no longer respond to the needs
of the world; rather the world must respond to the needs of cinema.The needs of Tarantino’s cinema are not
moral or ethical, but simply the production of spectacle. In the name of cinema,
history is reduced to fashionable tropes of style and attitude, and ideas to
the expressive mode of the comic book. </p>

<p>Inglorious Basters in
fact demonstrates how quickly spectacle spills over into parody, and, how
quickly parody is divested of meaning. Voided of meaning, Inglorious Basters
has no content, it becomes an emptied space located in spectacle. But in an era
characterised by the creation of the Trump mythology ( the God of the Deal) the
social and political objective is to strip discourse of notions of validity and
truth.To use tweets and postings as
psychopumps evacuating the oxygen of fact and truth from social exchange.The result is to create a situation of
informational entropy in whichevery
piece of information is equal to any other. A sort of law of universal equivalence.The
practice of Trump’s White House is to destroy notions of accuracy validity and
truth by drowning them in an overload of indifference and hostility.</p>

<p>This process of overwhelming truth with alternative facts of
course fits with Jenkins’script which
is based on alt truth in relation to the known facts of the first world war. In
selecting Ludendorff as one of her main villains, Jenkins had to undertake in
clear cognizance, a significant
distortion of history.She had to trash
the facts.But Jenkins, whether
consciously or not, has absorbed the tutelage ofDonald Trump, and in sympathy with his ethos
of alt facts, Jenkins sabotages fact for the sake of spectacle.Jenkins could have chosen to substitute for
Ludendorff a fictional character who resembled him.But she chose to go with the lie.Perhaps not so much for reasons of Box
Office, but more perhaps because like Trump, the lie is amongst other things, a
mechanism for flaunting her power.The
power of the lie over truth represents the truth content of this movie.</p><p>In that Jenkins takes on the power of the lie as the core to
her narrative, in a sense she also becomes the architypal shadow of her eponymous
hero, the dark side of the superwoman.</p>
