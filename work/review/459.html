<p>White man’s games</p>

<p>Kathryn Bigelow's ‘Detroit’is a movie whose background/narrative is built about the 1967 Detroit
riots.Her movie starts with an intertitle
text that gives a brief grounding resume about the situation, in the 1960’s, of
Afro-Americans in Northern states of the USA.The text tells of the large migration of Southern Blacks to the North that
took place before and after the First World War.They left the South to escape poverty
discrimination and segregation, and to take up work in the rapidly expanding
industrial and manufacturing economy of the Northern cities such as Chicago and
Detroit.White unease with this
migration caused a steady movement of white population to the suburbs and
zonally segregated housing.The text
concludes that with the rise in racial tension, ‘Change’ was ‘inevitable’.</p>

<p>What the text doesn’t quite say, but the movie to some
extent does show, is that in the North Afro-Americans encountered aphantom segregation phantom discrimination
that mirrored their previous experience in the South.But this phantom discrimination was unlike
that in the South. In the North discrimination was/is never openly admitted or
acknowledged.It’s the North’s dirty little
secret, made most visible in policing: the use of City Police Departments to
make sure the Black populations were kept in line by intimidation, that Blacks knew
their place and were brutally reminded of their worth.</p>

<p>Bigelow’s Detroitsets out its stall with a text, albeit with a rather woolly
socio-cultural statement, but one that at least gives the film an initial
context.But after this opening, Bigelow's movie becomes progressively decontextualized
becoming a sequential series of genres, locating race problems within the realm
of the move type. Detroit changes its
concern and its focus as it slips out of the context of race into the comfort
zone of familiar Hollywood audience fodder: the spectacle, the horror movie,
the oppositional court room drama.</p>

<p>Bigelow’s camera structures her film from the conventional privileged
theatrical mode, allowing her story to
be told only through conventional narrative and editing means. But
the pain of racial discrimination, in particular in relation to Afro-
Americans, is something felt from a point of view, a point of view of those
experiencing it.Bigelow’s scenario
never allows her camera to take on point of view of the subjects, it simply
trudges around capturing the action.</p>

<p>After the opening text the second section of the movie
places the camera in the midst of the Detroit riots.The camera moves around to cover different
areas of the riot action introducing both the white psychopathic local
guardsman Krauss as he murders a black man by shooting him in the back, and to
the members the Dynamics as their gig is cancelled because of the riots and
they hole up in the Algiers hotel. The Detroit riots, sparked by a late night
police raid on a Black party, are characterised by confusion and chaos.With the introduction of the riots, Bigelow
in the manner of her filming moves off the focus on race, to shift the visual into the familiar
Hollywood zone of spectacle. Even with Krauss’ murder at the heart of the riot
section, the emphasis is on action covered from multiple locations,not on meaning. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The third section of the movie is set in the Algiers hotel
and is a dramatizationof notorious
events that occurred in this location at the time of the riots. </p>

<p>A group of Guardsmen force entry into the Algiers Hotel
where they believe a sniper may have taken shots at them.At this point Bigelow shifts her film firmly
into the category of genre.‘Detroit’
now turns into a certain class of horror movie.Whilst Bigelow and her script writer Mark Boal, may say that race (and
sex black men with white women) is still the primary element in the incident,
my feeling is that the mechanics of the theatre of cruelty take over and
dominate the film at this point.The
psychopathic Guardsman, Krauss uses his position of temporary but total power
and domination to psychologically torture abuse physically assault and finally
kill those in his power.Krauss is driven
more by his own gratification than any other motivation.For Krauss race legitimates his actions but probably does not drive
them.He might behave in a similar way
to his wife. Movies in which a psychopath plays cruel games with people under
his control a old Hollywood territory, familiar from gangster films and
parodied by Tarantino.</p>

<p>The third section of the movie,in a court room setting with the alleged
perpetrators of the Algiers Hotel murders on trial, is mechanical in the manner
in which it is scripted and shot. A rerun of a thousand familiar filmed
renderings of the Court Room drama.It
reminds the viewer of Perry Mason, Man Called Ironside or perhaps more appositelyInherit the Wind or to Kill a Mocking Bird.In
relation to these latter works Detroit lacks their intellectual focus and
intensity. ‘Detroit’ as it switches to
Court setting, simply remains in game genre mode.One in which we see the familiar site of
lawyers bludgeoning witnesses, biased judges favouring one parties objections
and the eventual outcome of innocence for the whites.Again Bigelow and Boal might say that race is
the focus of the way in which this section is shot.But without point of view, shot simply as an
oppositional court room drama it is the structural elements of the theatre that
dominate, not the dilemma of race.</p>

<p>‘Detroit’ I think offers nothing to understanding of the
playing out of race issues in the USA.Without being able to offer some sort of point of view, either of black
or of white, the issue of race is reduced to simplistic cinematic formulae.</p>
