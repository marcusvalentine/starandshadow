<p><span>The InnocentsJack Clayton (UK 1961)Deborah
Kerr; Michael Redgrave</span></p>
<p><span>writing credits: John Mortimer,William Archibold, Truman Capote</span></p>
<p><span>viewed Tyneside Cinema 5 Jan 2014;ticket: Â£6:95</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>There is a moment at the height of Miss Giddens' epic
contest with Miles where she is seen in full 'battle regalia' her luxuriant
hair let down like a warrior.Until this
point her hair, neatly pinned up has been a symbolic token of her reason and
self control. As her rolling lockscascade over her shoulders we see for the first something of her primal
energy.In the movies, hair cuts tell
their own stories about the characters, suggesting in the lines and contours of
the hair something about the landscape of personality underneath. In this
letting go moment it felt like Miss Giddens had arrived at an epithany, a point
where she recognised that to 'win' she would have to call up from within
herself unfamiliar latent forces.A
'hair-down' shot in which Clayton would start to release something of his own
invention into the scenario.A moment of
truth which would transform the staid dull neuroticism of Deborah Kerr's
playing into something energised.The
Innocents would be transformed into a film inspired by not inhibited by, Henry
James' magnificent short story: The Turn of the Screw.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>But this moment
remains simply that, a brief 'hair encounter'.After which the movie returns to the mechanics of its laboured plodding
Gothic plot.A telling of the plot that
significantly diverges from the original telling of the story in as much as
where James teases and finally opts for a phenomenological ambiguity, Clayton
plays out a literalistic interpretation.Of course every film finds its own path through its material to its own
form. Clayton in opting for development of specific plot mechanics over
character development, leaves his film with an empty centre. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>The Innocents pivots on the performance of the role of
Governess Miss Giddens.She is the soul
of the work and Henry James wrote his novella in the form of a letter written by
her.This letter structures the work as a point of view: a seeing and
recounting of the events.This is one of
things James explored: how seeing informs understanding.However in the Innocents film version, we
don't see things from her point of view. Sometimes we do but mostly we get a
camera taking up different narrative roles dominated by overdetermined affect
images that Clayton asks Deboral Kerr as governess to give.The role of governess is defined by
stereotypical faciality of the melodramatic horror genre characterised by the
lowering of the jaw, the stretching of the skin over cheek bones, the widening
of eyes.Locked into her rigid
characterisation Kerr, directed by Clayton is unable to suggest the chaotic
mental states that characterise perception and judgement in unstable psychic
relationships.And so, like a fire,
without sufficient psychic energy to consume, the film slowly dies down and
goes out.There are a couple of moments
with both Miles and Flora that kindle, but in the end instead of a focus of
intent, there are just images edited and manipulated to impose the occasional
shock on the audience.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>The other weakness of the Innocents is the failure of
Jack Clayton to create a world within which to locate his action.The action mostly takes place in a large
country house called Bly.For the film
to work the location should take on some numinous identity of its own.The setting should emanate a sense of
presence and immanence in relation to the events that it secretes.But Clayton doesn't develop the house as
anything more than a backdrop to the action.Looking at the garden and the house, the props suggest a polymorphous
raiding of the studio'sprop
cupboard.None of the items, the statues
the pictures the drapes have any resonance.The best shots are the over the shoulder tracking shots down the
corridor (which might have influenced Kubrick's Shining) and the use of the
windows as mirror reflectors of faces.But neither of these more effective shots are intrinsic to the fabric of
the setting, they could be part of any large house.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>David Lean, in films such as Great Expectations and Brief Encounter,Â  anchored his films within the numinous possibilities
inherent in created and imagined worlds. His characters and plots were embedded
in in the very fabric of his settings.In this film adaptation of The Turn of the Screw, Jack Clayton needed to
better understand that the content and features of his setting were central to
his artistic vision.</span></p>
