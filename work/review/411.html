<p><span>It’s Christmas Eve and time to eat and rejoice and to suck cock</span></p>

<p>Sean Baker’s movie Tangerine is about desire.Specifically the streets of LA or any large
city as portals of desire giving onto open spaces where desires are embodied
and satisfied in forms outside the censorious morals of ‘normal’ society. </p>

<p>Tangerine, so called presumably because of the fake tan colouring
of the ladymen hustlers, comes up from the streets, with a sassy ‘know it’
voice.A movie with a voice that says I
want.It wraps the audience up in the gladiatorial
defiance of the transsexual street whores locating the action on the LA
Boulevards that are the points of intersection between the transgender hustlers
and their clients from the straight world. The structure of the film comprises a series
of cameos from the two worlds that finally lead to the collision of the two
cultures in the local doughnut store.</p>

<p>Sean Baker’s Tangerine fronts up the street persona of its
two leads hustlers.Sin-dee and
Alexandra are the axies around which the film whirls as they strut across their
Sunset Boulevard turf, a zone characterised by the fractured architecture of
retail and commerce.Baker’s movie is driven
by iPhone cameras that track and trace the enraged war dance of betrayed Sin-dee,
playing out her theatrics of vengeance.The iPhone the chosen tool of the street workers:
drugs gangs prostitutes and cabbies,
brings immediacy to the volatility of mood and light that are part of the
film.The iPhone as a tool of the selfie, everyone
is playing out to themselves.That’s the
scene.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mechanised sex, women paid and used as ‘come’ machines has
always beena recourse for men either as
pimps and exploiters or as clients for distraction entertainment or
frustration.Hence the inherent
vulnerability of women in the trade: they got to be both ends facing.The issues of the ladymenseem to me to be different. Sin-dee and Alex realise their desire to be
ladymen makes them social pariahs.Being
street whores, dangerous as it may be, has possibilities.It enables them not only to flaunt what they
are but also gives them a certain type of discreet power. Their work is a
vindication of a life.</p>

<p>Sin-dee and Alex are comic book gothic characters.Like Superman Spiderman and the rest,Sin-dee and Alex are superheroes (‘superheroes have feelings too’ as Batman
once said), with their own costumes and their own special powers. Powers of attraction and repulsion.As the iPhone follows Sin-dee with her power
walk, her huge fake mop of flowing locks (like a WWF fighter), her scaly hose
and tight hot pants, we get the message:this girl can fight. </p>

<p>At the core of the
expressive game of adopting the persona of the female but retaining the physiognomy
of the male, is a claim on personal power. Immediate power.Power based on being different from
appearances, being ambiguous, being
knowing, being potentially dangerous. It’s
a personal power generally confined to particular situations: entertainment,
brothels, certain types of streets and perhaps the home.Spaces
where the persona is protected from institutional hostility and assault.However vulnerable and inadequate the cross
dressing whore may be there is something in the choice that involves integrity,
and integrity is a source of inner belief.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In Tangerine, the power of the ladymen is on the streets.At the
other end of the spectrum lies the conforming power of the home.Conversely the power of the home is often
weakened out on the streets where it is overwhelmed by a culturally engendered
overflowing sexuality that can no longer be contained by conventional strictures.</p>

<p>Baker’s script cleverly takes the two worlds of objective
and subjective desire and sets them into momentary interpenetration. Baker
selects for his ‘home’ subject an Armenian immigrant (Razmik), married and part
of a large (and probably unwanted) extended family.Razmik is a cabby.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Christmas Eve: Here are the streets;here is the home…I want cock…</p>

<p>Baker chose not to depict an American. American’s these days in big cities never drive
the cabs.Only immigrants drive cabs: long
hours and usually treated like the nobody they are.So Razmic is a cabbie, an Armenian, part of a
close knit newly arrived immigrant family. So it is a real traditional family and the
script is set on Christmas Eve when all the values of the family, its love its
consideration, are set to full display mode.But Razmik, after plying the cab trade all day, likes to take time out
sucking cock of ladymen.The desire for ladycock overwhelms him when
confronted on Christmas Eve by his family who want him be part of their
embrace: the wife the mother in law the kid the cousins and aunts.But he is possessed by the image of
Alex.Her image her power reaches out to
him, overwhelms him .He makes his
excuses (gotta work!) and abandons the family at their Christmas Eve party,to seek out Alex and suck her dick. </p>

<p>And so it comes to pass that in the doughnut store where the
film begins the stories reach their climax.The two worlds collide in a finale of ‘scandal’.It’s very funny, but the script doesn’t
simply exploit the humour of the situation.It stays responsive to the human factors in play, and this is the
defining feature of Baker’s scenario. Both in the doughnut store and in the final
street and launderette scene, the characters affirmboth their dignity and humanity.Both
worlds, the street ladymen and the family world understand something:they have to look after each other’s vulnerability.</p>
