<p>Loveless<span>Andrei Zvyagintsev (Russia 2017)Maryana Spivak, Alexsey Rozin</span></p>
<p><span>viewed
Tyneside Cinema 13 Feb 2018; ticket £9.75</span></p><p></p>Mechanical film<p></p>
<p><span>Like
Three Billboards, Loveless has a pretext at the core of its script: the
disappearance of Boris and Zhenya’s son Alyosha.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>This
pretext is in itself rather ridiculous and barely stands up to even superficial
scrutiny as it supposes that the son of this blighted couple was enough of a
clueless sap not to realise that he is totally unloved.Given even the glimpses we get of the parents’
relationship with Alyosha before his disappearance event, it is not believable
that his overhearing of their attempts to divest themselves of responsibility
for him can have done anything other than confirm what he already knew.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Zvyagintsev’s
real intent in Loveless is to make some sort of critique of the relations
characterising Russian society by stripping bare the nature of his characters
self centred existence, existences detached from any sense of the shared life.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>But
it is typical of Zvyagintsev’s conceit that he imagines the audience will
accept Loveless as any sort of real critique.It’s a movie that using the resources of script, camera work and face is
packed out as a realist fable but is simply an exercise in manipulation. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Manipulation
is all that Zvyagintsev has to offer.As if Zvyagintsev was the first to observe that the continual obsession
with mobile phone impoverishes being,indicates lives cut off from the world and their own feelings; as if
Zvyagintsev’s camera with its continual slow tracking into the object of the lens:
the couples fucking, the people sleeping,
means anything other than manipulative dramatic heightening of the image; as if
the exaggerated hard faciality of Zhenya was anything other than a director’s
trick to pander to the audience.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>With
its slow tracks, its hard rictus, its closed off script with its soap opera
retorts and gestures, feelings of
hopelessness are scored into the grain of movie.The audience are in effect excluded from
Loveless, as Zvyagintsev doles out his banal insights with the subtlety of a
sledgehammer.There is nothing to see in
the film other than Zvyagintsev’s diktat.In a film about relations there are no other meanings than what the literalism
of the director construes. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>In
indication of Zvyagintsev’s literalist method is to be found in the scene where
Boris and Zhanya visit the morgue to see if they identify a body as that of
their son.With the camera on the
parents there is the moment of theatre as the drape over the body is pulled
over to reveal the corpse.There is the
reaction of shock as the parents (Zhenya in particular) reacts to the horror to
the sight of the dead boy. Eventually both parents stammer out that the body is
not their son. That is enough.The scene is complete.We need to know, to see no more.For a secondI was a little surprised thinking: Wow! Zvyagintsev has resisted his
compulsive literalism for once has not shown us the body we do not need to
see.But at thevery instant of the thought Zvyagintsev cuts
away from the faces of the parents to the body that we don’t need to see.This body we have already appraised.You can’t keep a good man down.Zvyagintsev’s compulsive literalism and his
need to show it all, win out.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>This
scene is characteristic of the movie.The script is heavy handed, soap opera stuff with every biting insulting
line delivered by the divorcing couple underlined – so that we get it.The acting the fucking deliberately
orchestrated by the banality of the camera work, construed so that we get it.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Zvyagintsev
has nothing in common with Tarkovsky.He
is a sort of obverse social realisttripping out an individualised moralism.Looked at form one point of view his directionshares many of the traits of his
protagonists. In Loveless, there is no
perception of what is happening only mechanics (including the mechanics of the
organised search for Alyosha which rakes up a lot of time) , no state of mind,
no point of view. Just Hollywood back stories and strips of action from the location of work.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Opening
his film with a series of black and white shots of the nature, the forest the lakes the birds, and finishing
the film on the strand ofconstruction
tape lodged in the tree where Alyosha had thrown it in an earlier sequence, doesn’t
not make Zvyagintsev a Tarkovsky style film maker. He has simply learned from
the surface of Tarkovsky’s ideas and missed the substance. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>And Alyosha
stays disappeared. He doesn’t show up in
the final reel.But there again Zvyagintsev might not have known what to do
with him. </span></p>
