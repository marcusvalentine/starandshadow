<p>FrankLenny
Abrahamson (UK Ire 2014)Michael
Fassbender, Domhnall Gleeson</p>
<h4><span>Viewed: Tyneside Cinema 13 May 2014Ticket: £8.80</span></h4>
<p><span>Life’s
a pitch</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Frank
felt like a movie that began life as a pitch at one of those low budget BFI
workshops and things sort of developed from there.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>In
the beginning is the Image.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Lenny
Abrahamson’s Frank is dominated by the eponymous rock group lead singer, Frank who is a sort of inscrutable smiley face
head on a lolly pop stick.All image
little substance.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>As
an image Frank is an eidolon, a graphic escaped from a children’s comic who
armed with an actual body and a set of attitudes, has been animated and
released into the world to expose the disjunction between his comic book
immobile childish features and his pressing adult needs.A suggestive analogy.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>As
he energises his band, leading the musicians to their in the rural retreat,Frank rivets the attention of the viewer
dominating the visual field of Abrahamson’s movie.Should you try to look behind the mask to ask
what’s there, the answer is ‘not much ‘.Frank started life as a great pitch, but as the scenario developed the script had
nothing more to offer than a laboured formulaic story rich in suggestion poor
in actual realisation.The script tries
to suggest Frank as a charismatic character, but presents the viewer with only
a suggestion of this idea,‘Frank’ is
little more than a series of vague suggestions. But the image is great and to
make a low budget BFI type movie image, a USP might be all you need,</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Image
is everything. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Abrahamson’s
Frank is ultimately an empty vessel: image with no content. As such it is the product of the age and the cultural
forces that have produced the advertising industry and the various types of
youth subculture. In both these cultural epiphenomena image is the mirror by
which the spirit is enticed into the promised embrace of new narcissistic
relations.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Within
a social system defined by insecurities the ad industry connects desires to
products;in a world defined by the collapse
of traditional markers of personal and social identity, youth subculture is a
line of escape which again involves conforming self image to a more or less
vague life style and concomitant values. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>I
am what I see in the mirror.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Frank
is structured through the eyes of Jon through whose voice events are rather
laboriously explained. Jon is one in a long line of ingénues, such as Melville’s
Ishmael, who report back on world’s that are normally closed off.Jon is pitched as a wannabe musician, shackled
to semi detached suburbia, and set free by the invitation to join Frank’s
band.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>The
band retreat to Ireland to record an album.But to record an album they have to find an identity. which is of course what Jon craves most of all.The identities taken up and tried on by
Frank are like ready made off the peg solutions.Taking a series of off the peg garments off
the rail of socio musical affects, Frank leads the band through the Hippy trip,
the Lou Reid trip, the Devo Land trip.Perhaps part of the film’s allure is its mechanical switch through
identity modes.The film finally comes
to the RD Laing trip as the prominence of mental illness in the group is taken
up by the script. But the relationship of the the group to their mental states
is ill defined. There is nothing proposed beyond the suggestion that these
people are simply, ‘other’ ‘outsiders’
who have some how come by some process or another to have been labelled.But mental illness is Frank again seems to be
part of the sales pitch:it is crass and
superficial as evidenced in the Don’s suicide which (with its somewhat
desperate contrived presentation) seems no more than a device to keep the plot
cranked up.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>The idea of mental illness is simply a notion
put into service as part of the mechanics of the story. The script needs mental illness, so it is
imported at no great cost to any one.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>As
nothing in Frank actually means anything, this gives the actors a particularly
hard time. It’s like they are trapped in a music video that goes on for about
20 times longer than it is supposed to.There is simply so place for the actors to go gesturally or
developmentally, so their only recourse is to cycles of repetition.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Domhnall</span><span>Gleeson in his ingénue role of Jon flounders
in a sea of inconsequentiality.He is
simply left bereft by the script that demands him perform ridiculous acts of
thespian contortion to keep his character running on the plot rails.The other member of the caste also suffer
from the same fate with the script unable to provide them with either any
recognisable continuity or purpose. This
is particularly true of Frank, who is interesting initially as a sort of Warhol
type figure upon whose bland exterior anything can be projected.Michael Fassbinder, undermined by the demand
an idea that lacks purpose into which he can fold or against which he can react,
ends up looking like he doesn’t know what to do, except to do as he is told by
Abrahamson.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>The
use of social media lamination, Jon’s purported blog, face book and Twitter
entries and his ‘secrete ‘filming of Frank ( how anyone at close quarters could
film is a open question) are again the signs of a film that is lost and unable
to see clearly what it is really about.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>Conceived in the image, Frank is unable to find its way
beyond the image.An idea with potential
is lost to the pitch.There are a few
laughs, but mainly of the cheaper variety.</p>
