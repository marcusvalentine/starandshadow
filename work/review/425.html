<p><span>The
Leopard (Il Gattopardo) Luchino Visconti(It 1963)Burt Lancaster; Claudia Cardinale</span></p>
<p><span>Viewed:
Tyneside Cinema 8 June 16; ticket £8-75</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>The
Leopard about whom it is said that he cannot change his
spots&hellip;</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Visconti’s
The Leopard is permeated by filmic ideas relating to movement and false
movement. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>The
real movement in the film is there before our eyes continuously present for
us.In the furling and unfurling of
cloth drapes and curtains. In the billowing of dresses as they swath the female
form and suggest and anticipate the ebb and flow of psychic tides:the incessant agitation in the spirit of
times trapped in the rigidity of death.Visconti’s (V) intelligent eye is fascinated by the suggestive
possibilities of the fluid.In the
opening sequencethe wind breezes
through the opened French windows; thelace curtains billow gracefully; as do the winds of ideas that gust and
fill out the action.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>The
false movement is the incessant movement of people as they flow through the
frames of the film.The people are false
in their moves: across rooms,in
religious piety,in presentations.All this movementleads nowhere.The populated zones in the film self consume
swallow themselves in determination to set things in a motion that is circular
as the serpent that swallows its own tail.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>There
are moments that are still in the film.Thelongueur of the unchanging
immobile land. The landscapes still and devoid of people shot by V aschoreographed tracks and reveals, paintings
characterised by ochre faded under the intensity of the sun.This burntpastel quality of the land contrasts with the interiors which are set
piecesdensely peopled and colourised,
the men bound in and woman billowing out and flowing as if anticipating a real
change, a feminisation of the social order.V uses this contract this movementto suggest that all this out flowing all this female excitement and
movement isthe new force that cannot be
contained. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>At
its narrative surface the film relates how the times change. How the old order
of Sicilia gives way to the new order of the Resorgimento: Garibaldi and Philip Emmanuel guiding the
people, the youth of the country to a new united Italia.But as V unravels the film we see,through the intelligence of the Prince that
nothing in the essence of the political order changes.There is the illusion of change, the conceit
of social movement.But nothing in fact
happens andthe Prince sickens as he
watches the nothing happening.In all
the talk of revolution he understands that there is only an adroitly played out
political game of musical chairs.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>The
thought occurs that perhaps that one of the reasons the Prince is enervated and
sick, isbecause he has nothing to
resist.He reaches a point in his life
when he wants to fight;he wants to
oppose something, to define himself by noble opposition, to stand up for what
he believes in.But there is nothing to
believe in: nothing to oppose because nothingreal has changed in the world.People may believe in the notion that something has changed, butthere has been no real political transformation.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>But
nevertheless the film is about change. Not political change: the wind of
change.A wind that blows as thedresses of the women bustle, this world
depicted in the film is full of change.The Prince comes to understand this.Whatis changing is not the
things that everyone thinks.Another
spirit is moving, and it has been picked up and imprinted in female spirit and
captured by V in the grain of his film.It lies in the growing consciousness of the Prince in the contrasting
forms of the feminine in the character of Angelica that move through his
consciousness. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>In
contrast the Princess rejects joy love and sex.She is bound to a male world of procreation and honour where the
feminine spirit and ethos are rigidly and anally bound to the duties of child
production.But Angelica is
different.She is free.From the moment that we and the Prince first
caste eyes on her as she enters the Palace almost bursting out of the bodice of
her dress, we know that she’s the carrier of change.She is the fulcrum of the films meaningrepresenting something in the female spirit
that is quite independent of the world of men.Completely free of the rigid coded stratifications that bind this
society.Whatever happens to her, something
of her spirit will always survive in the same way that the Sicilian psyche
always survives.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>The
film’s climax is the union of Angelica and the Prince in dance.The dance is her idea, her proposal to the
Prince.In the dance as they move
serenely across the floor, the Prince ,who yearns for change for release from
the dead world of duty that he inhabits, is briefly shown, as if in a trance or
dream,the possibility of another world.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>This
dance with Angelica in her white floating dress is like a fairy vision bestowed
upon selected men who are permitted to see clearly and deeply into the real
nature of the world.Like the stories in
which a fairy takes a man for a day and a night revealing to him the world of
magic dance and music, only for him to return and find that everything has
aged.So it is with the Prince.After the dance, which is an intensified
surrogate marriage and heightened revelation of a course in life not available
to him, there is nothing left for him to do but die.After the dance he is broken because he has
fallen out of time.He belongs to a
present that is receding accelerating into the past.Angelica is the future denied him.Angelica’s life is for the succeeding
generations.It is time for him to move
out of the picture.But he understands
why.Not intellectually, but as an
animal understands, viscerally.The
Princeaccepts death as it blows across
the fields and down the mountains, only seeking somewhere to lie down
forever.</span></p>
