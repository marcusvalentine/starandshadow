<p>Vivre sa vie: film en douze tableaux J-L Godard (Fr 1962)Anna Karina, Eddie Constantine (spectre)</p>
<p>viewed Tyneside Cinema 5th July 2016; ticket
£9.25</p>

<p>I film therefore I am</p>

<p>After the opening title sequence Godard’s Vivre sa vie cuts
to a long durational close shot in which the camera, tracks between a couple
who are seated beside each other on bar stools at the counter of a café.They are talking about the nature of their relationship
and its break up.As the camera tracks
back and forth across the space between them, only one of them is ever in frame,
and the shot set up is from behind, so that as they talk,we see only the back of a head.</p>

<p>The what is said by this shot is in itself both witty and
analytic.It allows the camera to
express the opening concepts of alienation, separation within a context of
movement.The wit lies in emotionally
de-saturating the dialogue from faciality as Nana and her ex talk about the
failure of their relationship her beef about his attempts to control her and
his economic angle as Nana’s ex signs off with the observation that as a
musician, Nana is leaving him because he is poor.The ultimate deficiency in a culture based on
consumption rather than production. </p>

<p>With Anna K playing the role of Nana Godard’s film is in
content, a modernist rephrasing of Zola’s eponymous novel charting the
transformation of a young operetta star into a high class prostitute, whose allure
and cold blooded exploitation of her sexuality destroy all the men who become
infatuated with her.</p>

<p>The power of Nana’s presence is described by Zola as a
psychic emanation that irresistibly attracts male desire.Godard’s transposes elements of the Zola
story.But because this is now an image
driven culture, his Nana in the form of Karina, exists as an object of desire
for the camera. It is Godard’s camera that loves her image embraces and devours her.When Nana leaves her job in the record shop
and takes up prostitution, her male clients barely seem to notice her. Throughout the film the men are self absorbed,
as if playing pinball or engaging in masturbation, they barely notice Nana.She is simply someone they pay.Unlike their wives or girlfriends they have
to shell out coin. </p>

<p>The Cool.</p>

<p>The ethos of cool detachment pervades Vivre sa vie.The guys all wear coats turned up at the
collar as they move through a world of artefacts, cafes, and automobiles.The women, immaculately coiffed and kitted
out with couture outfits and shoes.It
is a world without emotion, the world of advertising, where there are settings
backdrops and product display.</p>

<p>But Godard fixes his movies with pure concept.To oppose Nana’s image defined world he uses
a number of cinematic devices, simply interpolated that he cuts into the body of the film. Like the
chapter headings they comprise a breaking up of flow, an opening up different
idea spectra about what we are seeing.</p>

<p>The intercutting of a section of Dreyer’s The Passion of
Jean d’Arc. Godard uses a scene with
Artaud, theoretician of the theatre of cruelty who plays the monk, <span>Massieu questioning Falconetti’s
Jeanne.The Material grilling the
Spiritual.A section of Edgar Allen Poe,
the master of unnameable dread (uncool) is read on camera andlater during one of Nana’s assignations with
a client, the results of the statistical survey of Parisian prostitution are
intoned as voice over.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>There
are two more extraordinary interpolations inserted of the body of the
film.The scene where a guy mimes the
process of a little boy blowing up a balloon.As performance it is intense funny and suddenly in its intensity and
power feels like a transposition ofmale
ejaculation.A hyper parody of
inexistent sexuality.In a nondescript section of a cafe, Nana and a
Philosopher talk about life specifically focusing on ‘love’ (uncool) at the end of their discussion. Unlike the tracking two shot at the front of
the movie, this is shot full face with and pans from Nana to the Philosopher,
with the Philosopher finally concluding, in response to Nana’s question that
love is real “…on condition it is true.”</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>In a
culture of image how to find what is true and be able to distinguish it from
what is not true?In a world of
mirrors….</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Eddie
Constantine appears as a spectre throughout Vivre sa vie.His presence as an image inside Nana’s head a
constant source of reference. And it is almost as if he were in the film, and
if you squint your eyes you may see him.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>With
Godard, film doesn’t just think, it lives and breaths a world of unseen possibilities
. </span></p>
