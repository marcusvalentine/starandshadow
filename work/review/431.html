<p></p>
<p><span>Abbas
Kiarostami 1940-2016 – let there be life.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>The
two shots of a tin can rolling down a street in Kiarostami’s Close-Up,
epitomise something essential in the nature of his film.In the first shot the journalist Farazmand
accidently kicks a can sending it bouncing down the street.It might seem that this is an arbitrary event
but Kiarostami’s camera stays with the can as it clatters down the street
before finally coming to rest.Later in
the same sequence Farazmand again kicks the same can, this time deliberately, and
it clatters further down the road, ending up nestled against the kerb. The film immediately cuts to a shot of
newspapers rolling off the press with the story of Sabzian’s impersonation of
the director Makhmalbaf.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>These
‘tin can’ shots reminded me of Sam Mendes film ‘American Beauty’ where we see a
shot of a crumpled plastic bag blowing about at the end of an ally.It is blown about unable to escape its
confines, watched by Lester the movie’s protagonist. Like Kiarostami’s ‘tin can’
shots it’s of long duration, signifying that the director attended to the shot.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Mendes’
shot struck me as a piece of pretentious symbolism, using this heavy handed
visual metaphore to convey Lester’s state of mind.It seemed a contrived psychic moment, an
otiose signifier adding nothing to the film. Without a visible agent, the shot looked artificial,
simulated either in production with a wind machine or in post-production.</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span>Kiarostami’s
‘can shots’ have a quite different quality. An agent kicks out and a tin can rolls noisily
down the incline of a street.The ‘can
shots’ has nothing to do with narrative or state of mind, they simply fit the structure
of a film which is non narrative non linear and incorporates chance and
inconsequentiality as part of life.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Close-Up
is a mixture of documentary, cinema verite, dramatic reconstruction built on a
premise in which the aspiration and practice of film making are a fundamental idea.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Into
this subject with its multiple laminations built on the complexity of its human
relations and the way people perceive one another, accident and material
irrelevance are incorporated into the material, Kiarostami observes that these elements of
life often intrude into the most fateful moments of existence.Kiarostami’s tin cans don’t mean anything
beyond themselves, like his film and its players, the cans simply run their
natural course.The viewer gets the idea:what a long way tin cans roll when kicked,
almost forever; what a huge clattering sound they make, almost deafening.The tin cans exist as an object of the camera’s
lens for their own sake: no state of mind, no metaphor. Just cans.Like the protagonist Sabzian, he is just
Sabzian.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Close-Up,
at one level, is a satire on the egotistical banality of film making that puts
the ‘Director’ at the centre of the process.Sabzian’s impersonation of a director stems from his perception of the
power relations he understands as being at the core of movie production. The
Director can make demands: on actors, sets, scripts.Like little dictators they have license to
make things happen according to whim or will.Sabzian’s position in society as an unemployed printer, a powerless
non-entity, lends huge allure to the idea of being a film director.One who calls the shots. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>The
difference between Sabzian and Western wannabees is that the latter are
thinking ‘career’.Sabzian in some
confused manner, simply wants to tell of his suffering.His phantom film making, like Bergman’s,is driven by an internal imperative. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>But
at another level Close- Up is an anti satirical statement about about a type of
film directing in which ego takes a step back.A film making based on a certain kind of perception about what film is.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Kiarostami
does not primarily use control and manipulation as the dynamic of his film
making.The basis of his film making is to
bring the idea to life.As a film maker
he works by releasing ideas into situations and seeing to where they lead.Understanding where the idea takes the
material is for Kiarostami more important than any scripted destination.And his understanding and choice of situation
as the crucible for an idea is critical to his work.For Kairostami’s case the situations often
arise out of the power tensions endemic in the social matrix.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Close-Up
like most of his films is set in Iran. The situation Kiarostami develops leads
directly into cross sectional view of Iranian society.In the Law Court scenes, the family scenes, at the police station, we understand that Sabzian’s actions don’t
take place in a vacuum: they occur within a complex interweaving of social
relations: his mother, his wife, his children, his unemployment, his movie
going.We see how the private, the personal,
and the social interpenetrate. We see that these relations comprise a defining
framework in relation to action that is separate from the subjective, but has
its own weight.In contrast, American
and increasingly Europeans make films which are increasingly concerned only
with subjectivities. Individuals act as if in vacuo,as psychic agents of their own desires.Kiarostami’s films are set firmly in the realm of the
social.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>In
the final scene Sabzian is released from prison and at the gate he is met by Makhmalbaf.The film’s pay off was to be the recording of the conversation between
the two.But for some reason the radio
mics fail.Though we see the two men
meet, we hear nothing of their conversation, only static and bumps from the
sound system.Accidents mistakes and
failure are part of life, and Kiarostami films life.So he lets the shot with its no sound ride. A
joke on him and on all who are would-be controllers.In an important sense it doesn’t matter.What we see is enough, the idea of themeeting is enough to carry the shot through:
the real faker and the would-be faker have met and exchanged…whatever…we don’t
need to know more.</span></p>
