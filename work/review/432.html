<p>embrace over the abyss</p>

<p>Tarkovsky’s Ivan’s Childhood<span>,  
</span>is a film made on two distinct tracks: the audio track and the visual
track. The audio track carries the ethical stream of the movie with its
opposing concerns: the subjectivity of Ivan’s determination to fight the Nazis
and revenge the death of his parents; and the objectivity of the Soviet officers
that Ivan must be sent away from the danger of the front to military
school.Ivan’s youthful adolescent
obduracy of purpose and selfjustifying ordinance
overwhelms the protective instincts of these hardened soldiers.Of course the dialogue/audio ‘track’ of the
film is superbly filmed by Tarkovsky’s camera, movingbetween Ivan and the officers, capturing
Ivan’s defiant energy and the lesser conviction of the officers.The space between child and man.An ineffable unbridgeable space.</p>

<p>In the visuals
however Tarkovsky explores and probes expressively the more deeply hidden more
poetically evocative layers of the film, that comprise a metaphysics of death
and destruction.Tarkovsky’s ability to
create and educe symbolic ideas purely in the realm of the visual becomes his
keynote and defines all his subsequent productions. </p>

<p>One shot in Ivan’s Childhood points directly to Tarkovsky’s
vision of war. The Nazi’s as an example
to the Soviet fighters of the fate of those who spy and scout, display the corpses
of two hanged Russians. Paul Virilio writes, such displays of sacrificial
victims are “ an act of internal war, a throw back to war’s psychotropic
origins in sympathetic magic, the riveting spectacle of immolation and death
agony, the world of ancient religions and tribal gatherings.” The
insight in this quote explains something of Ivan’s immersion into the war,
expressed solely as picture.An immersion that takes him beyond the purpose
of retribution.Destitute and alone
after the murder of his family, entering into the theatre of war releases Ivan from
the purely personal, lifting him into a primordial originary collective world. Ivan
becomes party to the delirium of war; war captivates him as he surrenders to the
same forces that made the first primitive cave paintings. He gives himself over
to the workings of fate, even so that fate has marked him out for sacrifice.</p>

<p>Tarkovsky’s exteriors shot over the front line of Russia’s
rivers marshes forests capture war as a magical spectacle.An hallucination, war as a fusion ofexploding light reflected and refracted in
nature, inducing an altered state of mind both at one with the spirit of life
and with death, ecstasy and self destruction.</p>

<p>And right from the beginning of the movie Tarkovsky captures
in Ivan this possibility of sacrifice.Dressed only in shorts naked from the waist up the first shot captures
Ivan in a pristine landscape.We hear
the cuckoo, we see the spider’s web, we see the land.At one with the land, merging with it.The lean white skinned boy imprints on the
viewer’s mind an androgynous physicality: walking running drinking straight from the
bucket of water his mother has drawn from the well.He has animal soul, animal energy, this
boy.A vision of something pure, unsullied
by calculation.The fate of his beauty
is not to be tamed; not to be schooled; not to disciplined by life in the
soviet union in agricultural college or a mechanics institute. The fate of his beauty is to be sacrificed,
to be offered up to the war. Ivan is white virgin beautiful and in the maelstrom
of war embraces his fate.Perhaps the
soldiers also understand something of this as they cease to oppose his will and
collude with the Ivan’s act of oblation.</p>

<p>Of course this is metaphysics not history, but strangely as
the late Michael Herr also notes in Dispatches, metaphysics has its place on
the battlefield. But not in history. History doesn’t do delirium.As a counterweight to Ivan’s delirium, the
penultimate section of the movie is a series of shots depicting the capture of
the Reich Chancellery by the Red Army.We see Goebbels’ dead children and Goebbels and his wife, their heads
burnt to charred stumps, laid out on the ground for the Soviet
photographers.The arch Nazi
mythologist reduced to an all too real dead lump of matter.And inside the Reich Chancellery officers who
had known Ivan find his file, and the prosaic fact that he had been captured
and hanged by the Nazis.We see his
picture. He is just another victim.</p>

<p>There is one famous shot in Ivan’s Childhood, a shot that is
not apparently connected with Ivan.In a
sort of subplot, an officer aggressively pursues Masha, a medical officer. In
the disorienting setting of a birch forest, after an almost ritual chase he
catches hold of her tightly round the waist pressing her hard into his
body.The camera changes position and we
see that he is straddling a deep ditch and that she, with her legs danlging in mid-air,
is trapped between intimacy and the danger of a high fall.The shot works on its own narrative terms:
the desire of men for women.But more
strongly it stands as an analogy for the nature of war as experienced by those
who fight: a mixture of forced intimacy and terror.</p>
