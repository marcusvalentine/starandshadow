<p>viewed Tyneside Cinema, Newcastle9 Oct 2016; ticket £8.75</p>

<p>no pushing against</p>

<p>Nostalgia was the first film made by Andrei Tarkovsky
outside the Soviet Union.Having seen
the complete set of recently remastered Soviet produced films, it
is evident that Nostalgia is very different in quality from these films that
preceded it.</p>

<p>Tarkovsky’s Nostalgia is the film of a lost film maker, a
film maker who has lost his energising force.In Nostalgia he is now creating images out of an unopposed subjectivity
rather than making films that had an opposing subjectivity.Those filmsmade in the Soviet Union have the quality of a pushing against the wall
of a rigid ideology; Tarkovsky’s cinematic visionary language probing water as
a psychic element, surface as an hallucination and time as an instability
cohere as images directed as opposing concepts/metaphores. In Nostalgia’s scenario, there is no pushing against; rather there is an attraction, a pull towards visionary
utterance that is detached from the gravitational pull of the social
matrix.Tarkovsky’s cinematic language loses
its coherence and becomes a scattered atomised set of images that inceasingly
reflect the subjectivity of exile.</p>

<p>Seeing Stalker Mirror and Solariswhat is striking is that they are all films
that have an intensely political dimension in so far as they comprise a
sustained creative assault on the official Soviet ideological take on cosmology:
that time moves foreword as a progressive dialectic and that there is only one correct
way to understand history whether it be personal or social, and that is through
the materialist philosophy.These rigid
ideas are difficult to understand or comprehend today – though Islamic State
have their own contemporary version of a preordained cosmology – but these
ideas were the key underlying principles of the legitimacy of the Soviet
state.These philosophical propositions
underpinned, in so far as they justified and legitimised, the existence of the
state and all actions of the state from the gulags to the development of
nuclear weapons.The dialectical
progress of history, one dimensional time.</p>

<p>Tarkovsky’s movies blew a hole in this monolithic thinking and
for that reason were allowed very limited distribution in the USSR.Tarkovsky’s heterodoxy is exemplified by the
opening sequence in Mirror: Ignat turns
on the TV, which is an exemplar of progressive forces and after the screen’s
initial static and white noise the image resolves and we see a healing session
where a middle aged woman medium cures a young boy of his stutter.  The objective technology of the medium, TV, relays a message
which is a subjectivity. </p><p>Both Solaris
and Mirror view time as a element that overwhelms us: objective time is a
delusionary concept for the history books and Marxist philosophers.For Tarkovsky’s time is a non linear medium
that haunts shapes us and confounds us:mothers elide into wives, men merge with the identity of their own
fathers.We re-live and re-experience
time as a force that guides the dead as well as the living. The dialectic is
soul death; for Tarkovsky time is soul full.The cogency of Mirror and Solaris with their complex structures derives
from Tarkovsky’s certainty about what he wanted to say.His marriage ofcompelling imagery, often composed as long
in-camera takes, and temporal instabilities was possible because he was guided
by an underlying implicit form that gave him certainty about what is was
opposing with his subjectivity: a barren materialist ideological system. </p>

<p>And this barrenness was acutely expressed in Stalker with
its metaphorical journey through a toxic land towards a room where a wish would
be granted – perhaps the final realisation of proletarian state. Stalker is a
primed satire on the poisoned nature of the Soviet Union and its prime victim,
individual vision.Most of the
distinctively voiced film makers such as Bergman, Goddard, Bresson have one
explosive idea that animates what they do.However brilliant their images, they are not just image makers: their
images serve the greater idea.However
wondrously shot and imaged, Nostalgia never attains anything more that a
subjectivity in image.Through self exile
with the loss of both his sustaining culture and his oppositional situation in
the USSR, Nostalgia seems a lament to the pain of exile; beautiful personal but
ultimately an indulgence.</p>

<p>Many of the devices that characterise Nostalgia, in
particular on the sound tracks, seem consciously borrowed from his earlier
movies.The unending rhythmic footsteps
that accompany everyone,the incessant water sounds creating an
aqueous overwhelming water effect recall Stalker, as do the strange distant
quasi industrial sounds that appear in many scenes (as in the shot in the narrow
street with the mirrored wardrobe).Nostalgia seems also to share a large number of visual devices with
Stalker:the camera’s love of patina
texture and surface, the observation of water in all its multifarious still and
moving forms (an enduring feature of Tarkovky’s vision) and the tracking
shots.However in Stalker, the
significant tracks were often shots that moved through or moved towards the
object of search: forewards pushing
shots. In Nostalgia the significant tracks tended to be sideways movements.One of the last sequences of Nostalgia
comprises a long sideways epic tracking shot of the Andei fulfilling his
promise to cross the pool with a lighted candle.After initial failure he succeeds, and
immediately collapses.My feeling is
that Tarkovsky as a filmmaker highly sensitised to his own state of mind,
reflected in his use of lateral movement, his own self perception as a film
maker in exile. He was no longer an artist going foreword he was an artist at
this point deflecting to the side.</p>

<p>In Nostalgia there is no opposing rather a lateral movement
to those forces sidelined by society the holy fools the mad visionaries. But finding alliances in those declarations of
universal love and brotherhood or in obscure subjective self imposed tasks
lacks the imperative stricture of the previous opposing filmic statements. In making films for Gosfilm if Tarkovsky
allied himself with the mad and the visionaries he would also by default oppose
the determining ideology.Making such a
film in the West falls into a vacuum at best, and at worst a vacuum contained
by platitudes.</p>

<p>In one dialogue Andrei is talking about St Catherine and her
meeting with God who tells her: “You are she who is not.”A pointing of state of mind that seems to
underlie the majestic finalshot of
Andrei by a pool that starts as a close up and pulls back to a huge wide shot
that reveals him is a tiny figure in the ruins of an enormous arched cathedral.</p>
