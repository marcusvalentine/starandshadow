<p>The Killing of a Sacred DeerYorgos
Lanthimos (Uk/Eire/Usa 2017)Colin
Farrell; Nicole Kidman, Barry Keoghan</p>
<p>viewed Tyneside Cinema 8th Nov 2017; ticket:
£9:75</p>

<p>check your watch, it’s myth time.</p>

<p>Lanthimos’ movie‘the
Killing of a Sacred Deer’ (KSD) is a black comedy which Lanthimos guides with
uncompromising intent conforming his film to the strictures of myth.The protagonist, heart surgeon Steven Murphy,can no more avoid evade or circumvent destiny
than could Oedipus or Iphigenia.The
forms adopted by myth are relentless engines of design that comprise those
devices that lead to the preordained outcome: those that are marked to die, do
so die, not by law but by force of logic.</p>
<p>Lanthimos holds his sacred deer to logic.</p>

<p>Lanthimos’ script and scenario locate his film in the
psychic heart (sic)of America: the
hospital; the suburbs, generic settings that characterise the experience of
being in America.</p>

<p>The filmopens with a
long durational shot, the huge close up
of a heart undergoing open surgery.Initially this shot of Lanthimos seemed to be gratuitous, focusing our
attention of the establishment of Steven, the heart surgeon.But as KSD progressesthe shot works through the material as a
significant allegorical pointer.That he
who would save the heart of another has lost his own heart, that issues of the
heart both actual and emotional are the core of the film
which takes as its subjects those who have lost their heart, who have traded
their feelings for a series out outer gestures.The main settings, the hospital
and the suburbs, are understood as emptied spaces, vessels evacuated of meaning
where the living perform the motions of being alive, but are absent from life itself. They water the plants, walk the dog, eat dinner,
they live not as desire, but as mechanical rites.</p>

<p>Lanthimos’ camera films the main settings the medical
andsuburban zones as dis-connected from
the humancharacteristics that should
define them. The institutional shots of the hospital record
the flat nature of the interfaces and surfaces: the long corridors, the
consulting rooms, the patient rooms. One overhead shot onto the huge hospital
escalators works as a condensation the hospital image: the industrialisation of
the sick body.In the domestic location
of the Murphy’s upper middle class family home the furnishings, the house
design all seem selected not so much for use but rather as statements how the
Murphy’s want to see themselves. And as
Steven Murphy whirls about the suburban living room of his nice house, shooting
randomly with a shotgun at his blindfolded and bound wife and two children,
although no attention is specifically drawn to the expensive buttoned Chesterfield
on which Ana is bagged and trussed, its quiet expression of money provide an ironic
counterplay to the frantic comic scene being played out.</p>

<p>The core of the film is the eruption of myth into life. Myth
as the dynamic that makes the heart pulse with life.Jung’s
idea of myth as a form, a pre-existent mode that takes complete possession of a man or
woman, defining appropriating situations so as to guide and mould their outcome.Once a mythic form castes its shadow across
man, the ending is predestined there is no avoidance of a particular fate. Myth
as an archetypal force that shapes destiny has its counterpart in scientific
theories such as Darwin’s natural selection, where outcomes, the plumage of a
peacock, determine the stages of its development. </p>

<p>That myth is a psychic reality, that nothing can happen
without a pre-existing form (Jung) lies the heart of Lanthimos’ perception.It is the truth engine that drivesKSD.And the compelling effect of his film is that he overlays the implacable
logic of the playing out a sacrificial myth over the inconsequentiality of the
life lived by his central characters.The Murphy’s live in the bubble of the American consumerist society,a land in which everything can be fixed, where
there are no consequences.The
outplaying of KSD is that this suburban dream life transposes and without anyone
noticing is subsumed into a mythical form, in which everything has consequences
and nothing can be fixed or averted.Steven will not be taking Bobby for piano lessons.Stephen
will have to shoot Bobby.Lanthimos
films and structures KSD in a neo-Brechtian vein of realisation.The shots are naturalistic but also have a
didactic quality.Visually the shots of
Bobby and Kim dragging their bodies across the floor like huge slugs are
logical extensions of their situation.But as mythical images they have a didactic purpose, and also confirm
that KSD, like many of von Trier’s
movies, is a black social comedy, not a horror film.</p>

<p>The acting, as with Lanthimos’ other films is finely
threaded into the skein of the movie.Colin Farrell takes on the patina of an ancient tribal king, all beard
and deliberation, underplaying to deeper effect.The close up’s of all the players of which there
are many, all have a distinctive quality of affect images which deepen the
connection of the viewer to the unfolding events.Two in particular, a shot of Ana shadowed by
a tree, which seems to suggest a gallows shot, and the big close-up of Kim
riding pillion on Martin’s bike.Her
face is set in a classic comic book True Romance expression of the girl who has
found her first wonderful boyfriend.The
girl who in this moment has had all her teenage fantasies fullfilled.Yet we know that this boy is the Angel of
Death.And the Angel of Death himself,
Barry Keoghan plays out as if he comes from the deep subterranean world of the
Pythian oracle.</p>

<p>The West with its intransigent individualistic ethos, with
its belief in self determination, is highly antagonistic to the proposition
that people might be assimilated by mythic form.But perhaps in a social culture where collectivities
and communities are disintegrating we become more vulnerable to being subsumed
by mythic forms. Community and collectivity imply shared aspects of
destiny.The lone individual is unhinged
from the psychic anchor of the shared life, and as needs must have to forge their own fate.But without cultural resources it is perhaps radically
isolated individuals who are most vulnerable to being assimilated into the a
pre-existing form of myth.In particular
those myths that speak of frustration fear and anger at not being able to
control destiny.Myth such as the Herod
myth with its massacre of the Innocents.Perhaps gun men, such as Steven
Paddock the Las Vegas mass murderer, kill precisely because they are vulnerable
to myth that give psychic reality to violence.Thus vulnerable they assimilate and act out forms such as Herod as a means of giving direction to a bereft
life.Submission to the force of myth
gives meaning and purpose to life when it becomes unbearably inconsequential. </p>
