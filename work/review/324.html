<p>Beyond the
Hills(Dupa
Dealuri)Christian Mungiu (Romania
2012)Valeriu Niculescu; Comina
Stratan; Christina Fluture</p>

<p>viewed: NYFFTicket: $25</p>

<p> Not dug into the Hills&hellip;</p>

<p>Beyond the Hills (BH) looks like and is written and acted
like a TV movie.I didn’t see
Christian Mungiu’s (CM) feature Four months three weeks two days, but looking
at BH he does not seem to me to count amongst the innovative distinctive group
of filmmakers who have emerged out of Romamia in the past decade. </p>

<p>BH is set in a rural Orthodox community of nuns who are led
by an priest. Its driving narrative mechanism invokes Alina’s search for
reaching for an old friendship within the parallel world of a religious space.BH presents as a movie that is
uncertain of itself, or its theme and this uncertainty is most of all
communicated in the way in which it has been produced and shot. </p>

<p>BH is a laboriously played out drama that attempts to adopt
some of the outer signing of filmic signification, but<span> in this </span>signing it simply lacks, significance.For example CM’s deployment oflong hand held tracking shots and cinematic ployssuch as focusing his camera's attention onto
the details ofthe set or the
setting.As if such gestures could
in themselves be enough to substantiate a claim that we are watching a film rather than
a TV movie.  BH flaunts some of the outer appurtenances of filmic technique,
but lacks understanding ofhow they might actually work as part of the movie.</p>

<p>There is a problem with the long tracking shots, such as the one in
the opening sequence in which the steadicam follows Alina as she walks beside
the length ofa trainat the station, to find Vouhita.All that is indicated here in this long
shot, is a laborious durational literalism.  It does not invoke a transposable relational structural idea that might inherently
link the shot to core theme of the script which which is a certain type of ‘seeking out’.   Perhaps the shot would have worked better if Alina had been filmed walking into the steadycam.A recurrent weakness of BH is that a heavy handed
sort of literalismcharacterises
most of the long duration shots.A
literalism that leads nowhere. The camera that can record
everything but reveal nothing.The long shots, devoid of any filmic thesis or
inherent tension only add duration to the material, ( the film is 2 ½ hours
long) and contribute nothing in substance to the film’s core ideas: neither the quest for
unequivocal friendship; nor contribute anything the audience’s understanding of
the unfolding of events. </p>

<p>CM’s directorial handling if BH raises questions as to how
the technical and cinematographic structuring elements of a movie relate to its
filmic theme or subject. </p>

<p>For instance in a recent film, Once upon a time in Anatolia
by Nuri Ceylan, the theme, and the narrative revolve round the idea of
‘uncovering’, an uncovering at different levels; both physically in the form of
a body, and psychically in the musings and fears in the minds of the
protagonists. In the long night of the first section of the film, the long
takes have the effect drawing the audience into the nature of searching for
things in the darkness; of a groping towards andofan uncertainty in the
characters, the which mood lies at the heart of the film.The way the film is shot,
including the long shot of the girl serving tea to the searchers by oil lamp, is grounded within
the film’s core.The setting, the
use of illumination as an the idea that little can actually be seen, and the shot
duration, are intrinsic to the film’s unfolding, the nature of the
manifestation of light let into obscurity&hellip; </p>

<p>Those film makers who are certain ofwhat they are doing, contemporary film
makers such as Ceylan, Porumboiu, von Trier, Haneka,the themes and structure of their films are grounded in the
way in which they are designed shot and edited.So lighting and sound designs the nature of the
originating medium, the way the film is shot are all intrinsic to the theme of
their material.</p>

<p>What seems to happen is that more derivative film makers
admire some of the affects arising out of grounded movies, perhaps mistaking
them for stylistic gloss, and adapt ideas or borrow these production and filmic
affects fortheir own
purposes.In effect they graft
onto their material technical and production solutions without understanding exactly
how they actually work as grounded signifiers.</p>

<p>I believe that CM in BH has mistaken simple duration of shot
as an affect that can transpose the idea of the search for meaning. In fact
other shooting techniques in relation to intensity and quest, might have worked
better.In this case the HD origination
of the material was also counterproductive; visually also presenting a
literalist image rather than the softer more inchoate yearnings for an
uncompromised relations.</p>

<p>Even on its own
terms as a plodding narrative I did not find BH convincing. My festival
companion at the movie was Ana Marton, who had seen CM's ‘Four months…’. She felt
that the critical relation in BH the friendship or ex friendship Alina and
Vouhita had been written and depicted by a writer who knew little about woman’s
friendships.The friendship as
depicted in BH seemed designed to express conformity with the demands of the
script rather than authentic movement of two vulnerable women.The two actresses seemed to have been
given personality instructions by CM and then had to keep to that character
profile, to do as they were told.The result is two mono dimensional performances that hardly seem to
register the one to the other, as if each actress were isolated from the other
in a sort of character bubble.I
do wonder how the ‘jury’ at Cannes arrived at the decision to give both
actresses the Palme d' Or’for
these perfomrances?  I don’t get it. </p>
