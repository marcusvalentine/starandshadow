<p>La Grande BouffeMarco Ferreri (1973 Fr, It)Marcello Mastroianni, Michel Piccoli, Phillippe Noiret, Ugo
Tognazzi,Andrea Ferreole</p>

<p>Fin de partie</p>

<p>In the best epater and fuck the Bourgeoisie tradition, La Grande
Bouffe is an uncomfortable film to watch.Garnished with black humour its scatological scenario centres on the
social and physical relations of the great orifices.The caste glide through the film effortlessly
acting out the gross and indecent gestures and directions, guided by the
mechanics of a script and scenario which offer them the safety of detached but
implicated roles.</p>

<p>Watching La Grande
Bouffe I was reminded of the terrible ordeal of the Trough.The Trough was the cruel means of execution meted
out to traitors (and others) in the Archaemenid (early Persian) Empire. The theatre of the Trough went as
follows:first the condemned was fed a
large sumptuous feast.He was then
placed in a stone tough which was covered over with a stone slab that left only
his head sticking out.He continued to
be fed rich foods, spooned into his mouth by beautiful maids.But inevitably and inexorably he would
evacuate the contents of his stomach, emptying the contents of his bowels into
the stone trough where he wallowed in the deepening pool of fetid slime of his
own making. As the victim sat in his own
foulness his body was slowly and painfully eaten by the bacteria from his own
shit.</p>

<p>In the course of this gruesome ordeal the victim was witness
to the spectacle of his own death.Perforce his attention directed to the fact that the forces of physical
corruption that were consuming and destroying his body were directly related to
the corrupt moral forces that had infected his mind.The Trough was a metaphysical lesson for the
King’s subjects: that moral turpitude was a process replicated in and on the actual body.The instructive nature of the Trough was not
lost on spectators and calls to mind Kafka’s short story : In the Penal
Colony.Of sorts, a story of mindful
replication: infraction on the moral plane being inscribed physically upon the
body of the perpetrator, as a death sentence.</p>

<p>Watching La Grande Bouffe I see a similar moral lesson being
played out for today’s spectators.The
four male protagonists are consumed by the forces at play in a social system overwhelmed
by the excesses of individual desire.A
society driven to the frenzy of self annihilation by a capitalistic moral and
social imperative that has reduced all relations to the operation of profit and
power.And in La Grande Bouffe the cock
and the mouth are the chosen emblematic means that point directly to this
corruption.The strength of La Grande
Bouffe as film is that it is not symbolic; it films image to point directly to
effect. </p>

<p>Ferreri is a director of the warrior class. In La Grande Bouffe
and Dillinger is Dead he wields film like a battle axe to smash through the
glass plated hypocrisy of the times.At
its most straightforward Bouffe documents bourgeois society no longer defined
by self satisfied mechanical rectitude, but now defined by self satisfied
mechanical excess.Wealth food leisure sex
all reduced to the satiation of desire.Ferreri’s understanding is that this is a society in the process ofself destruction.Bourgeois society, in a spiralling cycle of
out of control consumption, will dissolve in its own excreta. </p>

<p>Perhaps Ferreri was thinking of another cycle of
degeneration that was clearly seen.The
processes that led Communism to destroy itself in the 1930’s 40’s ‘50’s,
purging itself to the point of complete denigration, so that in the end all
that was left was a group of geriatric psychopathic tyrants.</p>

<p>The active force filmed in Ferreri’s scenario is the social
dominance and arrogance of the male. This is a sufficient but not necessary
condition of the film’s moral purpose.But
it is maleness that is made exemplary. It is what the film points to with its images
of the four guys exercising their orifacial prerogative. What we see is the unfolding of Ferriri’s
uncompromising logic of truth when life is driven by desire. So the men’s
behaviour makes for hard viewing, and in as much as the film in making a truth
statement, it defies the viewer to avert their eyes </p>

<p>Like Bunuel’s films, La Grande Bouffe uses film to show the
viewer directly what is actually happening. In the blasphemous feast in Viridiana, we
see directly the destructive forces unleashed by the situation; in the entirely
different social setting of ‘Bouffe’ we see another type of nihilistic
behaviour. The men’s mouths and cocks
serve the same purpose – saturation through power.The men stuff their mouths with the food
their power commands;they strut their cocks
which they expect and demand of the women to suck stroke insert. Prostitutes are
hired to perform whatever is demanded by the men’s whim, as when Marcello
picking up the Bugatti’s exhaust manifold tells the prostitute that he’s going
to stick it up her cunt instead of his prick. She smiles and says: that’s OK.</p>

<p>Ferreri shows a society reduced to the gestures of
exploitation and excess. Looking back to 1973,it’s interesting that this time also witnesses the burgeoning of the new radical
feminism.It would be difficult given
today’s political discourses to produce a homocentric film of this nature, but
certainly possible to make a film that implicated both men and women in
amplified cycles of corrupted desires. What is lacking is the film climate that
would permit the complete honesty, possessed by Ferreri Bunual Bergman, needed to
make a film that pointed directly and logically to the corruptions that
underpin our consumer society of appearances.</p>

<p>Interesting that in
Ferreri’s script, it is the woman Adrea (wonderfully personated by Andrea
Ferreole) who is the only survivor of La Grande Bouffe.She cooks eats fucks wanks, equals in all
respects the men. She remains the only one left standing to oversee the second
delivery of the meats which will never be eaten. She stands perhaps as a portent of a future in
which overweening desire will also take on the female visage. </p>
