<p>Shadow DancerJames Marsh (UK 2012)Andrea Risborough; Clive Owen</p>
<p>Viewed: Tyneside Cinema:29 Aug 2012Ticket: £7.00</p>

<p>Famous red raincoat</p>

<p>James Marsh’s (JM) Shadow Dancer (SD) looks like a TV mini
series condensed into a feature film.It brings nothing to cinema except TV values, both in its aesthetic and
structure.</p>

<p>The main characters Max and Clair and Kevin are no more than
cogs in SD’s mechanical espionage like plotMax an MI5 officer who turns the IRA operative Claire
who is in her turn hunted out by her IRA minder Kevin.This being TV the character roles
depend on haircuts and costumes rather than more internalised attributes.The protagonist, Claire as a women has
to be drawn as a fully rounded character, a mother with a young child as well as
a terrorist. But even this dual role doesn’t extend the range of responses in
her as a character.</p>

<p>TV films like
to make the claim that they are about ‘real people’ (perhaps thismeans they are like the average viewer)
This controlling concept introduces into the core of SD a primary clash of
interests in the life of Claire: her family which defines her and her tribal
loyalty which prompts her action.Clair’s dilemma, set up in the second section of SD is that she has to
decide for whom she is playing: herself or the IRA.</p>

<p>At the level of its narrative SD is a concatenation of
unlikely initial propositions that proceed to become ever more far fetched.
Although in desperation JM tries to graft on a covert passion for Claire by her
handler Max, it simply reflects the film’s problems in maintaining its own
internal credibility.JM as
director is increasingly caught in a familiar pincer movement of hisown devising. He wants his film to have
a realist core: characters that appear to be located within the strong folds of
the everyday;but JM also wants
action.A certain
internal structural narrative logic is erected: the struggle, the family the
housing estate the political background.But this establishing narrative structure is increasingly discredited by
the logic of the action which makes demands that are at odds with
background.The background is in
effect degraded left behind by the primacy of theaction generated tensions: erotic violent emotional.</p>

<p>In SD, particularly in relation to Clair the two strands of
the scripting become increasingly detached.In fact SD is difficult to swallow even in its initial
proposition at the point when we realise the IRA have ordered Claire to bomb
London.She will be vulnerable as
an agent if caught (because of her family situation), but her IRA minders
overlook her unaccounted time in London.If we go with the poetic license implicit in this opening proposition,
we then have a narrative and action development which becomes increasingly
absurd.Claire goes to meet her
MI5 handler in a‘remote’ location
which she can only get to by walking or public transport because she does not
have a car.She walks or perhaps
buses (the film is silent on this point) to this rendez-vous dressed in a
bright red fashionable macintosh.Looking like a sexy telephone box in case anyone should have failed to
spot her. The action demands of film mean that Claire has to look attractive
and alluring and vulnerable, so she has to be provided with some sort of outer
garment sheath to signal these defining features.</p>

<p>What the film tries to do is to transpose the tensions of Le
Carre spook culture onto a more natural Irish setting.The poster for SD contains the strap
line: Mother daughter sister spy.Le Carre’s world, as depicted in novels and even in film, functions on
its own terms in a world parallel to the everyday.The mechanisms at work in the espionage world work better as
an abstracted tenplate on which the forces in play can be seen clearly. The
tensions the contradictions the stratagems of the spooks gain greater force and
piquancy.And the roles played by
the characters gain clarity from the fact that they are not the rounded
individuals beloved by the TV industry.</p>

<p>Caught in this
classic pincer of opposing purposes,SD has nothing else to do but take itself seriously as its story becomes
more and more of a joke.Though it
is a telling point that this is a film totally devoid of intentional
humour.Though there is in the
cack handed set ups, such as the attempted assassination,a certain amount of unintentional
humour.</p>

<p>Steve McQueen’s Hunger as a movie/installation added a layer
of understanding toBobby Sands:
the desperation of his situation, the Maze prison, the state of mind that
impelled him to direct confrontation with Margaret Thatcher.There is nothing like this kind of
ambition set in play here. The acting is all contemporary monogestural unipart
posturing, and the state of mind of the lead players ignored, they are no more
than the sum of their actions.</p>

<p>Max and Clair sleep/walk their way through the film.She in her famous red raincoat he in
his regulation fit spook English suit that says MI5.Their different conflicts are depicted as purely
mechanical processes instigated by the wheels of the plot which in itself is no
more than a sub standard le Carre fare. JM uninterested in anything other than
his plot mechanics, is unable to engineer any insight into character.He simply opts for expressive safety and
confines his players in a straightjacket of the one dead pan look </p>

<p>With so much Cinema sold out to the demands of the TV
companies, it is no surprise that the mechanics of SD’s are complemented by the
mechanics of the shooting script. JM’sfilm does nothing to alarm TV buyers.Its camera work concentrates on the routine collection
ofregulation shots/ reverse
shot.After its routine editing,
add some tinkly music and few old ‘70’s records, one red hot fetish raincoat
for the poster and the channel trail, and you have a very saleable TV movie that
is not cinema. </p>
