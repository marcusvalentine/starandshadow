<p>Charlie is my DarlingPeter Whitehead (UK 1965) Doc - The Rolling Stones</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>The Rolling Stones Charlie is my Darling Peter Whitehead (UK
1965;) and Mick Gochanour (USA 2012)</p>
<p>Viewed: New York Film Festival 29 9 2012Ticket Price: $20</p>

<p>Schizo movie</p>

<p>Complete with an on stage post - movie guest appearance by
Andrew Loog Oldham (ALO), Charlie is my Darling (CMD), or as they like to call
it, The Rolling Stones Charlie is my Darling,came across as a film with a split personality; a film that
had been handed over to a foster carer,and didn’t know who its actual daddy and mummy were. </p>

<p>The explanations given by ALO after the film left me in no
doubt that CMD is schizo film of the first order.It evidences all the symptoms of a subject experiencing the
classic double bind situation: a film that simultaneously admits and denies two
opposing types of propositions: that Peter Whitehead is the director and editor
of the film, but at the same,he
is not the editor and director of the film which blazons his name, like a
symbolic shield at the head of the opening credits. </p>

<p>Schizo as it is, CMD is of course an eloquent statement of
the convoluted tortured and contradictory claims that the corporate bodies
ABKCO, have had resort to, in their anxiety to justify their manipulations and
exploitations of theCMD material
in question.In their practice of
contradiction, they are like the Red Queen in Alice; and almost as funny.</p>

<p>Every medical condition has a case history and the history
of CMD is the key to its schizo development.CMD was made in 1965 by Peter Whitehead (PW) and
commissioned and produced by ALO.PW directed the film, shot the original footage on an Éclair,then edited it: his film.According to ALO speaking at the
New York screening, he as producer never really meant the film to be seen.ALO suggested that at this time. the
mid’60’s when other groups such as the Beetles were experimenting reaching out
and extending their audience and income through movies, he ALO only wanted to
see what the Stones would look like on film. ALO said he never wanted PW’s film
to be released. It was made as a sort of group audition, for appraisal and
their eyes only.ALO seemed
to suggest that he never seriously considered releasing CMD. </p>

<p>I found this explanation, though it may be true, less than
convincing.It occurred to me
there might have been other reasons for shyness.Perhaps PW’s edit of the material had been problematic: in
one way or the other.</p>

<p>In fact the original CMD had a screening at Berlin Film
Festival, and caused a stir.Itthen seems to have had
some limited form of exhibition.I
say this because on-line there are people who say they have seen it, but this
remains a little uncertain to me.</p>

<p>From his original footage, PW cut a film that I think was
originally about an hour,a little
less perhaps.This cut and all the
outtakes were then withdrawn in an act resembling a sort of distributive coitus
interruptus.Perhaps the film and
all the rushes were sold on with constraining contractual clauses and
eventually in the mid nineties, 30 years after the original shoot and
edit,they re=appear in the
ownership of Abkco, a large media conglomerate.</p>

<p>Contacted by Richard Pena in 1995 who wanted to screen CMD
at that years NYFF, Abkco say they have acquired the film and the rights and
are at work restoring the material.</p>

<p>Cut to 17 years later, 2012,  a film called The Rolling Stones
Charlie is my Darling turns up on the NY festival programme. A film by Peter
Whitehead, directed shot and edited by Peter Whitehead; <i>but als</i><span>o crediting a new role call of creative and technical
personelle:director - Mick
Gochanour; Editor - Nathan Punwar; Producor - Robert Klein!A schizo films with two sets of
everything.A film that took 17
years to sort out before this potentially desirable and profitable piece of
merchandise could be released.</span></p>

<p>After the screening I asked the director who was present but
not on stage with ALO what percentage of PW’s original cut was now in the film
we had just seen and which seemed to be titled: The Rolling Stones Charlie is
my Darling.His reply was that it
was about 60% recut.Which is fair
enough.But is this any longer
Peter Whitehead’s film?it is not
his cut.And is the claim on the
publicity postcard I have in front of me, that the film is directed
photographed and edited by PW in any sense meaningful?</p>

<p>Abkco are desperate for some reason (one wonders what this
reason might be - contracts?) for Peter Whitehead's name to stand emblazoned
over and across the film like an endorsement - not that there are many left
today except a few old film buffs who even know his name let alone his fame as
a film maker.</p>

<p>WhatI saw was
a schizo film from one of the homes of schizo capitalism, the entertainment
industry.</p>

<p>The film, the one with director Mick Gochanour bears the
unmistakable intensity and presence of all the camera work by Peter Whitehead,
and I was glad to have seen it for this reason. It lacks the originality and
dynamic that PW brought to fashioning and editing his material . The edit on
view is OK but is pretty standard treatment.So the original footage is extraordinary and apparently if
you buy the whole dvd package the original cut is included in the deal, though
at this point I don’t know if you would get all the original cut or whether
some scenes or lines, might have got the snip.</p>
