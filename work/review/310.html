<p>Imagination as the primary act of resistance</p>

<p>Fernando Arrabel’s (FA) Viva la Muerta is a full frontal
assault on Franco’s Spain, a country with its back broken by Franco’s fascist
death machine; the people murdered or driven to madness and denial by
repression and fear. </p>

<p>FA’s assault on the terrible damage wreaked by Franco and
his allies the forces of political/religious conservatism, harnesses the
intellectual and visceral power of savage satire exploiting the intermeshed
expressive elements of Artaud’s theatre of cruelty, Dadaism, Surrealism and the
Theatre of the Absurd, to fashion a filmic expression of deep passionate anger.</p>

<p>The opening title sequence comprises a series of panning
shots across a large scroll of sequential organised drawings, economically
penned cartoons of distorted figures caricatured in bestial form and depicted
in cameos of cruelty and sadism.The film starts with these disturbing images of body laid over a
soundtrack that comprises the voice of a child who nonchalantly and brazonly
sings a repetitive rhythmic refrain: to my ear a sort of crazy nursery
rhythm.The repetition of the song
chews into the consciousness of the viewer.I didn’t understand the words, which are in Danish (but may
be ‘nonsense’ like all the best child’s rhythms)but this child’s voice is saying something that anyone can
understand within the context of VM.The song is a challenge: it sets a mood and opens up a
mental space through which the film can filtered and understood.This song defines VM.Repeated as a ritornello. a leitmotif,
it carries the film’s key message.In its provocation, its invariance of tone, it communicates an
indominitable mocking spirit. However deep we are in the shit, however they
kill us and subject us to lies oppression torture and violence, we have within
us the means to fight back.The song
links ourconsciousness to the
possibility of resistance and struggle.It is a challenge to view the film in the state of mind that spits in
the face of the dealers in death.</p>

<p>This is the message FA has fashioned.A film grounded in a child’s song.</p>

<p>After the song the first words we hear are those of some
fascist soldiers on the back of a truck, singing they will murder half the
people if necessary in order to ‘save’ the country. Viva la Muerta!</p>

<p>A defining character of VM is that it is autobiographical.In terms of structure, VM is episodic
in form, but intimate in content.And it is the quality of intimacy that colours and fills out
understanding of FA’s film.Episodic films, employing dissonant disturbing images that define the
content are usually remote and distant as socio-political critiques. L’Age d’Or
never feels intimate; it feels produced to broaden consciouness as an
ideological act.</p>

<p>Employing every technique in the agit prop lexicon of
surrealism and theatre cruelty, VM is up close and personal.Using this broad palette of deranged
imagery, FA is always in control of the effects of the images he creates and
releases.I think this is because he
knows these people. They are not abstract or abstracted tokens representing the
forces of death.In flesh and
blood they are the people who killed his father and wanted to kill him.What in episodic films can seem
arbitrary and disconnected, in VM is hot wired to emotional necessitythrough
the umbilical cord linking his life to that of his mother.The personal and the political
are one.</p>

<p>The mother is the hub of VA.She is woman as living flesh.We feel her hand, smell her skin and witness her charged
repressed erotic relation to fascism, the Roman Catholic Church and the forces
of death. The film starts with a structured narrative core that connects
through the eyes of the child (Fando) his mother’s betrayal of the father and
her embrace of Franco. Interspersed in the key narrative (though the narrative
is never absolutely straight in its telling FA is too supple in his
conceptualisation for such restriction) are fantasial /dream sequences. In the
film they are presented as hazy colour washed sequences, often savage and
beautiful,psycho/temporal events
in which cruel insights and visions are perpetrated and experienced.As VM progresses the distinction
between the two strands breaks down, cracks up. The sequences characterised by
the narrative ‘look’ open up to extreme expressive material, (the priest eating
his own balls, the mother bathing in the blood of the slaughtered bull). In the
world ofFranco’s Spain there is
no longer any means of distinguishing different aspects of life, the real - the
imagined&hellip;The deployment of
systematic violence and cruelty has taken over the whole of the national
psyche: everything is nightmare.</p>
<p></p>
<p>VM is a
totality of commitment by FA to record what he saw and heard as a child, with
nothing unobserved through the scales of innocence.But this commitment, to stand up to fascism ( when it was
still a live force in Spain)communicates through all who took part in the realisation of VM.In answering the need to oppose
Franco’s Spain VM is part of the creative will of all those who contributed to
its making: the mask and prop makers, the cinematographer, the editor, but in
particular the actors who were prepared to undergo privation and undertake
provocation for the film to be made.</p>
