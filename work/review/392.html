<p>The Duke of BurgundyPeter Strickland (UK 2015)Sidse
Babett Knudson; Monica Swinn<span></span></p>
<p><span>Viewed:
Tyneside Cinema 6 Mar 2015; Ticket: £9.00</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Insecticide…the
bugs have the excuse of being dead</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>My
feeling after viewing the Duke of Burgundy was that I had viewed a sub-standard
piece of formulaic erotica directed by a director so seduced by his own imagery,
that he is unable to make films any more.The film dominated by Strickland’s input as writer director feels like a
love note to himself, a contemporary exercise in narcissism .</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>The
Duke of Burgundy is an indulgent graceless movie that lacking tensions and
ideas reveals Strickland as a film monger, who in this movie exploits form and
structure without content to engender the illusion that his films have some
sort ofsubstance. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>In </span>Katalin
Varga Strickland made extensive use of landscape to extend out the emotional
mood of his revenge narrative; in Berberian Sound Studio he made similar use of
Sound Track to feed and extend the layered narrative threads.In both these movies the form and structure
of the material fed directly into the
film’s themes and subject matter: revenge in the case of Katalin and in
Berberian, a notion of evil. </p>

<p>Visual parallels and sound fx, as types of bolted on imagery
can be a director’s cheap trick or a sign pointing to something about the
nature of the film.In the sense that
they don’t cost much and there is little risk involved in the exploitation of
this type of material there needs to be some sort of signage.The cut
away landscape shot in a drama demands the audience to make links implicit in
the juxtaposition of the two different sources of imagery. The use of suggestive and emotive sound as an intensifier,
is a stimulus that imposes itself on the audience’s anticipation ofand grasp of what is happening on screen.It is almost impossible for an audience to
either disattend it or disassociate strong suggestive sound effects from accompanying
visual material.</p>

<p>These devices used profligately are cheap tricks.Cheap tinny tricks can of course be turned to
cinema gold if the director understands something about the purpose of the
film. If there is a understanding of the worth, the truth content of the film
that corresponds to the extrinsic devices. Sometimes the signage comprises a moral (or historical) step
outside of the parameters of the film, an induced reference that connects all
the material.This idea of reference
which underlies films by Godard, von Trier, Haneka, is lacking in Strickland’s
film. </p>

<p>Katalin Varga perhaps justifies its vegetative references,
Berberian Sound Studio collapses in on itself unable to bear the weight of its
soundscaped and infested netherworlds.The Duke of Burgundy simply retreads Strickland’s previously used tricks
into the vacuous premise of a soft porn scenario delivered with high end
stylistic politically correct gloss.The
action shots of the film, similar to other high end soft porn vehicles
(L’Histoire d’O) are characterised by long meaningful looks between the players
(meaningful only if the audience decides to impute meaning to them, seeing in
them something beyond director’s instructions). These looks are always
characterised by a lack of blinking, blinking being an action of the eye, an
event, which interrupts the durational
flow of the look and hence changes the shot and the director’s imputed meaning
of the shot.The mannered non blinking
looks are complemented by a equally mannered delivery the the lines of the
dialogue.The dialogue is delivered in
the sort of dead pan abstracted manner that might belie the production of a
Monte Python SM spoof. </p>

<p>So the Duke of Burgundy all gets a bit silly. For all the paraphernalia
of seamed stockings, high heeled boots, bodices, bondage and SM persiflage that
defines the politically correct relationship between the female leads in their
big house, with their big bed, this movie runs on empty.</p>

<p>Interlaid (no pun intended) with this gash formulaic footage
are an multiple cutaways to two kinds of
visuals:landscapes (mostly trees) as in
Varga, and specimen bugs pinned to display boards ( I device I first saw used
in the 1965 movie the Collector). The
scapes are mostly fixed point shots, the bugs are mostly tracked.The bugs belong to Evelyn who enjoys entomological
studies.The multiple intercutting of
the bugs and trees seems an act of despair by Strickland.The Duke of Burgundy script, lacking in
tensions or externalities has no where to go and ends up going nowhere. Void of
meaning Strickland appeals to the conceit of the audience, asking them to find
meaning (or perhaps escape) where there
is none.To the long looks between
Evelyn and Cynthia Strickland adds the trees and the bugs asking the viewer to buy
into spliced in manipulation rather than significance. The use of sound effects in the film, likewise
replays Berberian, trying to overwhelm the viewer with the suggestion that
something is happening, when there is nothing except the presentation of turgid
stylisation of SM. </p>

<p>Filled out sound effects and tracks, incessant cutaways to
eternalities without referents, endless looks between puppet actresses, are symptomatic
of a lazy director, whose film empty of content has only saggy stylised form,
characterised by baggy shots, leaden pace and no tension.</p>
