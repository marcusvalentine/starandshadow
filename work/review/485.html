<p>First ReformedPaul
Schrader (USA 2017) Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfield</p>
<p>viewed: Tyneside Cinema 17 July 2018; ticket: £9.75</p>

<p>old man's film</p>

<p>Paul Schrader’s First Reformed prompted me to think about the
relation between the primary framing of a film, the way in which a film frames
its content; and the difference between subversion of frame and betrayal of
frame.</p>

<p>Subversion is radical reframing of a film’s material that is
designed to produce a complete shift in the audience’s perception of what they
have seen ( or perhaps what they’re seeing).A radical undermining of a movie’s premises. Subversive reframing is most often experienced
as a mechanical script device wherein at the end of the movie (or perhaps at
some strategic point in a movie) the
audience suddenly understands the narrative has been a dream; or that a
narrative that has been mediated through one understanding of its primary
frame, is suddenly inverted and seen through a new unexpected perspective.We understand what we have seen differently
with new illumination. </p>

<p>Bunuel and Godard were masters of radically subverting frame
and filmic form, with political or social intent.They both produced films that presented a
particular proposition wrapped in a particular genre or stylistic statement
that they subverted to open up the material to reveal a quite different reading:Simon of the Desert and
Contempt, in different ways, both have this quality of shifting frame:
challenging the audience to radically reappraise what they have experienced.</p>

<p>Alongside exploiting the capacity of film to subvert itself
there is the capacity of film to betray itself: to disrespect the audience in
an act of directorial bad faith.In
filmic betrayal we see a director shifting the energy of their film to transform
the way it is understood, but motivated by cynical or exploitative
intention.We see betrayal in its
mundane formin some Hollywood movies such
as the gangster films of the 1930’s after the introduction of the Code, where
contrary to the moral logic of the film, the forces of law and order and false
morality come out on top. Script
writing under the influence of ‘bad faith’ conforms narrative outcomes to the
dominant forms of political and ideological correctitude.Other forms of bad faith pander to commercial
considerations or the self image of the director as reason for betraying the dynamic
framing their films.</p>

<p>Schrader’s First Reformed is an act of betrayal. </p>

<p>The first shot isa
very slow track into the eponymous church.In this shot two core aspects of the movie are opened up.</p>

<p>Firstly through this shot the movie introduces itself as a carefully
crafted stylistic construct.This
formal visual introduction is confirmed in the body of the movie in which the
choreography of Schrader’s scenes are constructed in camera in a style reminiscent
of Japanese director Jasujiro Ozu.Like
Ozu Schrader constructs his master scenes using singular shots from an immobile
camera.The static camera frames a
space, often an unremarkable domestic setting, in which the characters are
located, in which they interact and through which they pass in and out of
vision.</p>
<p>Ozu’s method offilming, in particular Tokyo story, creates a primary frame thatreferences something about the nature of time
and something about the way in which the things that happen in life are never
fully seen.First Reformed composed in
like manner, references nothing about time, but does point to an endemic
formality that shapes interpersonal relations in the culture, as well as the
idea that there are areas of life that are closed off. His austere framing with his camera, makes a
statement about the way in which Schrader sees the nature of reality in which
he locates Ernst the priest. </p>

<p>Secondly, the opening shot introduces the church, the First
Reformed Church, a skeletal white structure more mausoleum than
church; a repository of God that is more tourist attraction than place ofworship.This church is a building mired in the past.Yet for all that it is a backwater, it is in
this place, not in the corporate world of full on Christian evangelism, that
Ernst has been sent. A dying priest in a
dying church. </p>

<p>Schrader’s movie, as in its shooting style, also in
content, has a recognisable starting point.</p>

<p>First Reformed’s protagonist, Ernst takes his cue from Bresson’s
Diary of a Country Priest.  It
is hard to believe that Bresson’s movie did not inspire and inform
Schrader’s decision to write and make First Reformed. In the opening section of the film Ernst, like
Bresson’s padre, reveals he has decided to keep a daily journal to enable him
to minutely trace his inner spiritual life. Ernst like his Bresson's protagonist,
elects to handwrite his thoughts and also finds that his thoughts gather about
his physical rather than spiritual state.Both priests are deathly ill.Both priests have been given their livings in appropriate backwaters
where they will be out of the way. </p>

<p>Bresson’s subject, made radiantby H L Burel’s cinematography is increasingly
abstracted from the world.His destiny
is to move towards grace. But Schrader’s subject, whilst he might want to leave
the world, finds his destiny to be in the world as he is drawn the deeper into
interaction with the exteriorities and complexities of life. </p>

<p>The scripted forces Schrader sets in motion make for a
powerful interplay of conflict opposition
and contradiction: the sacred and the profane, the physical and the spiritual.Ernst is increasingly aware of and disturbed
by man’s desecration of the earth.He is
aware that he is dying and progressively racked by self doubt and feeling of inadequacy,
ispushed into action in the world.He comes to see the need for his action in
increasingly violent terms.Ernst moves
into crisis as inner logic draws him into a defining act of violation
of all that he outwardly represents. </p>

<p>The nature and the means of his intended act of redemptive
violence hold centre stage. As the long planned commemorative re-dedication  of the First Reformed Church commences, the conflicting tension locates
itself in the body of Ernst:will his
action be directed against destroying himself or himself and others?And will his act be private or public.As the tension mounts Schrader chooses to
unravel his plot in a denouement of bad faith anti climax and betrayal.</p>

<p>Schrader having set in motion inexorable forces of logic
that demand resolution on the terms that he has nurtured, suddenly adopts a
narrative solution borrowed from old
Saturday morning cinema serials such as the Perils of Pauline: with a bound
Ernst is free.Schrader’s scriptditches everything it has developed to plunge protagonist and
audience into a Disneyesque fantasy.Ernst
finds redemption in a mystical union with Mary the wife of the young man whom
he had counselled before his suicide.Ernst
experiences a vision of oneness with life.The audience are subjected by Schrader to a magico realist sequence in
which Ernst and Mary’s merged and intermeshed bodies commune across the skies
like Mary Poppins.Instead of ending
with a death foretold, First Reformed ends with Ernst and Mary locked in an
unending kiss whilst the steadycam revolves about them. </p>

<p>This ending does nothing except betray the framing premise
of First Reformed.It may be Schrader thinks he is making some sort of
statement about the redemptive nature of love.But if his idea of love is chocolate box schmaltz, then Schrader’s
scripting lookslike the desperation of
an old man frightened by the forces he has himself has unleashed. A director who is desperate to pander to the
American palate for mushy food and soft landings, who has nothing to offer but
betrayal and Sleeping Beauty happy ending.</p>
