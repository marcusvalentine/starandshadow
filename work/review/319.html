<p>Batman- The
Dark Knight RisesChristopher Nolan (USA 2012)Christian Bale; Anne Hathaway; Tom Hardy</p>
<p>Viewed:Tyneside Cinema03 08
2012Ticket: £7.00</p>

<p>James Holmes is kinda hot - chelseah’s twitter</p>

<p>Pun in the sub title of the movie: the Dark <i>Night </i><span>Rises.As knight closes in on the American Empire only a purging apocalyptic
violence remains.</span></p>

<p>What does the audience see when they view the movie?</p>

<p>Better to begin with the film as affect rather than a stream
of thoughts that link the movie to the world and the social relations out of
which and from which it is projected - both in itself and in its associated
epiphenomena of death, represented most immediately by the murders committed by
James Holmes (JH).</p>

<p>The genesis of Christopher Nolan’s (CN) look and style in
Batman are the DC comic books fused with the imagery of the computer game.The movie replicates the
characteristics of the comic;nothing happens beneath the surfaces.Everything that happens takes place on the surface of the
screen: its sets locations and computer generated graphics.We read the movie in images, pictograms
to follow what is happening.Likewise nothing is left unsaid: what you get in the speech bubble is
all that is said.Everything can
be taken at face value.Batman
then has a mythic quality in this respect in that the issue of meaning is not
intrinsic but rather extrinsic and belongs in the realm of cultural
responses.</p>

<p>Neither in structure nor camerawork nor CGI is there
anything of filmic interest, CN defaults to Hollywood’s tried and tested
methods culminating in a cross cut finale.Interest devolves onto the internalised specific details of
production and what these signify.</p>

<p>The character of Batman himself is central to the film.It seemed to me that Batman is no
longer an alter ego of Bruce Wayne.The Wayne/Batman two hander is not just a simple character switch using
tights a mask and a cape.In the
movies depiction of Batman, Bruce Wayne is a cripple.A figure rendered powerless and impotent by his evident
handicap.Of course he is smart
but this makes his crippled state the more frustrating as his body can no
longer impose his will on situations.</p>

<p>The Batman costume has become more than a disguise.It is no longer a tight fitting suit
made of a yielding material that follows the contour of body. It has evolved
into an exoskeleton, a responsive total body prosthesis enabling Batman to
justify himself.The Batman
exoskeleton enables his body to impose his will on his enemies.To this extent it has the same quality
as the gun, say the gun used by James Holmes, which in US society has become a
prosthetic extension of the body.The prosthetic extension of choice for the child that needs to impose
the dictates of his frustrated will upon an indifferent world.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Likewise the machines used by Batman and Catwoman are not
actually machines.They too are
prostheses.Fantasial creations
stemming out of the fusion of comic and game.These devices are objects that are without traditional
operational considerations capacities or limitations.They are devices that are responsive extensions of
body and mind, seamlessly interfacing human desire and action through the
medium of speed.In the age of the
drone it is almost as if the power speed and intensity of these machines
enables them to accelerate through reflective ethical considerations and to
present the spectacle of the destruction they have caused as a logic in itself
that is right .Right because it is
too late to argue, and there never was time anyway.Military drones the Batmobile the Batbike existas prostheses to create situations that
are by the immediacy of their nature irreversible.The magical moment when the speed ofthe missile or the machine or the
bullet changes everything. The gunman looks down at the dead bodies in the
cinemaknows that he has done this
and things can never be as they were before.And this too is rightful.</p>

<p>A culture, not just American but world wide, in which there
seem to be changes to the psychic processes structuring the way we think.Increasingly action is an ideal that
bypasses thought.Action an
outcome driven by and governed by internally projected images drawn from the
collective resource bank of computer games and movies and given efficacy by
speed.Acton precipitated by
the rage of the child processed in an adult body unable to escape its deeply
internalised infantile needs.Immediate gratification of desire; intolerance of frustration.A culture that encourages fosters and
exploits these needs as part of our consumer culture.What we pursue is no longer the collective dream but
our own personal nightmares.</p>

<p>Progress adjusted to the profit motif finally seemed to have
come down to the irruption of a host of machine toys for adults who could with
their aid, do what they had been forbidden to do as children.(Paul Virilio - Ground Zero)</p>


<p>As the child has overtaken the adult so the image has
overtaken the process of thought.Cut off from any real collective life we revert to a stream of consciousness
in which a fantasy life of images is superimposed on our own internalised
states of mind.We transform
ourselves into the superstar of our own action movie. And since the Hollywood
action movie (imitated of course in cinema around the world) specialises in the
cathartic playing out of individual redemption by violent murderous closure,
then this too is the scenario of choice for numbers of battered bruised
psyches, who experience impotence and powerless opposition to the perceived
controlling forces that deny them.</p>

<p>James Holmes another way of being in the movie.</p>

<p>One feature of the Batman plot is that it is ultimately
meaningless.Well almost.The group who take over NYC do so
without any overt purpose.There
is no purpose to these people only state.We are to understand that they are evil.It is difficult to understand what is happening as anything
else other than meaningless destruction for the sake of it.Sense you cannot make of it; all
you can accept is the outcome:the
destruction of the city as providing its own justification. Right at the end of
the film we are given an explanation by the ‘uncovered’antagonist. All this destruction, and
the final detonation of the atomic bomb in the middle of the city isrevenge upon you and the way you
treated me and continued to enjoy your rich consumer lives as I watched on in
fury - but now my revenge is your destruction.This of course to some extent, in personalised
parenthesis is a slight echo of a jihadist statement.But more to the point it is the revenge of the child.Mass destruction no longer a function
ofpersonal gain, ideology,
religion, war, competition but of individual will. The spectacle of destruction
is consequent to the rage of the child inside the body of an adult that finds
its expression in the speed of imposed death. </p>

<p>CN’s Batman is characterised by the brutal periodic
irruption of meaningless violencethroughout his scenario.Meaningless in that the extreme violence is the mechanism for moving
action along.But then into the
cinema during the film steps James Holmes to perpetrate an action,to overlay the film with another act of
violence;meaningful to him but
meaningless to the audience who at first simply assumed he was part of the
movie.And in a sense Holmes was
part of the movie.He’s part of
the movie released into the theatre by the same forces that create Batman as an
archetypal cultural product.Enabled by gun weaponry prostheses to act out his own personal movie on
the biggest screen in the world inside his own head; the child man bearing the
fruit of his own frustrated desires.Be that the whole world is destroyed, I am vindicated.</p>

<p>In the penultimate scene of the movie the camera looks over
the destroyed infrstructure of Manhatton.The bridges blown away, huge areas reduced to rubble.A message does ring out: this is what
happens when America lowers her guard and puts down her guns…&hellip;but the message
seems to have overlooked the fact that the terror is now within the grain of
America itself and it has sown the individual seeds of its own destruction.</p>
