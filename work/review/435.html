<p>The Sacrifice Andrei
Tarkovsky (1986; Swe.)Erland Josephson,
Susan Fleetwood</p>
<p>viewed Tyneside Cinema 16 Oct 2016; ticket £8.25</p>

<p>time slips by</p>

<p>If Nostalgia seemed to be Tarkovsky’s attempt to recreate
himself in the West as Tarkovsky, the Sacrifice communicates as an attempt to
recreate himself as Bergman type visionary. Both in Nostalgia and in the
Sacrifice the defining truth content is spiritual angst. Whereas Nostalgia is
centred about a vacuity of gesture, the Sacrifice centres about an intensity of
gesture.Both gestures are prime
subjectivities and point to theemptinesses filling out contemporary life.In themselves neither film is successful in
expressing vision. Both films in their manner come across as re-active rather
than proactive in response to the tyrannical shibboleths of Western middle
class priviledged society. </p>

<p>Bergman as filmmaker is motivated by an internalised self flailing
that compels him to utter truth about life and relationships.Occasionally funny, but mostly hard honesty
is the warp of his films which are often characterised by sparse barren
psychically charged backgrounds against which  Bergman, from a series of actors,
 conjured performances of ingrained honesty.The films could only work to the extent that
his performers put their personal integrity in front of the camera.Performances were matched by scenarios that
generally avoided shooting tricks and scripts that  leaned towards the
spare.</p>

<p>Employing Bergman’s regular cameraman Nykvist and one of
Bergman’s repertory players, Josephson in lead role, with the Swedish shore
setting, and its note of spiritual angst, the Sacrifice has the look of a
Bergman film.But Tarkovsky fails to use
these elements in such a way as to own them himself.Despite the hall mark dazzling imagery and
the complex choreographed shots the film is pulled back into sub-prime Bergman
territory by a leaden script and lacklustre and uncommitted performances.The Sacrifice registers as nothing more than
a simulation.</p>

<p>Of course watching the Sacrifice with subtitles can make
performance evaluation difficult – not so with Bergman’s films – but I felt the
performances, in particular the female roles ( the male roles were not much
better), were wooden and lacking sincerity.This feeling of detachment in the
cast was compounded by the interior setting of the house and the costumes.
<span>The
female attire, dresses,  <span>and </span>in
particular those of Adelaide, her daughter (but also the maids)</span>



conveyed a nineteenth century atmosphere
to the extent the film sometimes felt as if it were in a Chekhov setting and
situation.Perhaps it was Tarkovsky’s
idea to meld social realist Chekhov with Bergman style psychic acuity?</p>

<p>If so it doesn’t work.The Chekhovian elements, the isolation the domestic setting the stories
told by the characters, lack Chekhov’s relational genius for tieing together
family and social tension.The
characters in the Sacrifice, are isolated entities with isolating stories.Alexander’s claim about his love for his son,
little man, is something said rather than seen.Filmically if he loved ‘little man’ then perhaps little man should have
died in the final holocaust. Perverse spiritual logic perhaps, but still a
logic whose possibilities might have attracted a director/writer such as von Trier.</p>

<p>And the Bergman elements fail at the first level of
authenticity in performance.Perhaps it
is language, directing his players in a foreign language (English probably);
perhaps directing emotion in micro settingsis not something that Tarkovsky was good at, perhaps happier in
directing in epic works.The acting is stale and stays emotionally tethered in theatricality rather than cinema. Also
the scripting and its realisation is critically lame. In particular there is
the ‘witch’ sequence, where a conveniently incoherent Otto persuades Alexander
to visit and screw Maria, the maid, whom claims Otto, is a white witch.The whole scripting is a dog’s dinner of implausibility, and that would be fine if the consequent action carried conviction.Again the feeling is that Bergman or von
Trier as scenaricists would have contrived strong central scene between
Alexander and Maria.Tarkovsky’s
solution climaxes in a magico-realist shot of the two making love.Whether this shot is understood as dream or actual,
the shot of the couple rising into mid-air and revolving round in space, seems meaningless, a desperately wrong solution.And for a film that is trying to combine Chekhov and Bergman there is no
room for getting central imagery wrong&hellip;</p>

<p>I think it is not enough to be a film maker.To make films outside the grounding of a
society or culture is difficult. Images are not enough.Very few film makers are able to work outside
their native milieus.Lang and other
German émigrés were successful in Hollywood as was Hitchcock, but they were
successful because they understood and accepted that to be American directors
they had to learn how to be one part of the movie making studio machines rather
than be auteurs.Recently the late Abbas
Kairostami made at least one successful film as an émigré, Like Some one in
Love, but his concerns were often in micro observation of individuals in
situations, a focus easier perhaps to carry into exile.</p>

<p>In his exile my feeling is that Andrei Tarkovsky never found
voice, and remained just a fabricator of extraordinary film images that lacked
clear unifying thematic purpose. </p>
