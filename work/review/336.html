<p>Stoker        Chan-wook Park (USA 2013)
 Mia Wasikowska; Nicole Kidman; Matthew Goode</p>
<p>Viewed Tyneside Cinema, Newcastle UK 
1st March 2013;   Ticket: £8</p>
<p>a kiss is just a kiss</p>
<p>This piece of Gothic Amerikana is in
one sense another revisiting of Park's  (P) favourite theme, incest.</p>
<p>The incest theme was the mainspring of
Old Boy and it is the psychic mainspring behind Stoker but for this
film the incest idea has been transposed to the ut - (dys)- topia of
suburban upper middle class USA.</p>
<p>The film takes its psychic mainspring
from the eponymous word in its title 'Stoker' Some one or something
that builds up a fire,  feeds the flames.  So either India's
hormonally charged sexual development that stokes the fire, or
perhaps the obsessive nature of hypocritical family secrecy, the
keeping of skeletons locked in cupboards, feeds the flames that burn
through the scenario.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Stoker (der
Heizer)is also the title of the first short story by Kafka and became
the first chapter of his uncompleted novel 'America'.   At the core
of the story is a grudge and the turning point of the story is a
revealed quasi incestuous relationship between nephew and forgotten
Uncle.  Although Kafka's short story is an imaginative journey, Kafka
expresses an intimate understanding of his characters; whereas Park
as director communicates detachment from his material.  As if his
main point of contact with this cultural strand of American life has
been watching the movies of Terrence Malick. 
</p>
<p>Like Hollywood in general and Malick in
particular a careful avoidance of context (social occupational
historical) is critical to the way that Stoker's coding deciphers the
human relations in the scenarios.  There are no dates, no real
occupations (there are offices locations of employment but these too
are dislocated decontextualised. [nb the deceased Mr Stoker is
supposed to have been an architect but the house does not look like
an architects home]), no media.  Only hermetically sealed worlds in
which the angels and demons of a shared post Spielberg moral
consensus can be set in play.   We are looking at a deterritorialised
characters.  They exist as oppositions in relation to each other:
husband /wife, brother/sister, mother/son, but not as possibilities
in relation to the world.  And it is in this world voided of the
actual, that Park has chosen to direct Stoker.  The world as a bell
jar.</p>
<p>P's style of filming is very like the
cinematography of Malick's movies.  The tracks have a similar slow
floating enunciate style which functions as a cue, that something of
significance is in train, whether or not this is the case.  The look
of the S has that same hyper real HD luminance that is intended in
Malicks's cinematography to imbue the shot with a symbolic shimmering
resonance; the more banal the shot the more both Malick and Park work
to give the images a liminal meaning to add lustre and link to
narrative structures shaped more by cod psychology than real forces. 
</p>
<p>Hence perhaps, this piece of American
gothic, like other films such as Ramsey's 'We need to talk about
Kevin', is filled out with Americana weird. Little shots, bolted onto
the shooting script to show us that the film has moved into 'weird'
territory, so that we can expect weird  'stuff' to happen.  Stoker
has it's insects (Bunuel inspired perhaps), the fetish object it
makes of India's shoes, eggs, the metronome etc all which are
supposed to imbue the scenario with psychic significance,
psychological depth.  In effect this style of film,to avoid taking
risks,  abuses symbolism as an cheap and easy means to express inner
movement.  The reason I use the word abuse is that the symbolism used
by Park here and Ramsey is plucked from a compendium of Freudian
dreams, an c arbitrary or opportunistic plucking from the dictionary.
The symbols and the symbolic images they generate are not won from
context, grounded in the material and then understood as possessing a
wider signification.  Like the shoes in S they are represented from
the start of the film as being very significant.  They then become a
little puzzle built into the film; why are these symbols significant?</p>
<p> Like Malicks's script, P puffs out S
with inscrutable philosophical phrases, lines spoken by the lead
characters.  These have a fake Zen quality, perhaps because faux Zen
is perfect grist to the Hollywood script mill.  Whereas insights that
are hard won in the Zen tradition, in the Hollywood tradition they
can be cheaply traduced as realisations,  exploited by Hollywood
scenarists who need a fix of philosophy to bulk out their characters.
 Malick tends to bulk out his characters' emptiness with little quips
about the realisation of 'love', by way of bestowing meaning on the
proceedings.  P and his script writer Miller, use the same ploy to
insert proto Nietschian sentiments into the mouths of the characters
from time to time.  So we have India telling that she is as she is
because&hellip;' a flower doesn't chose its colour.'   Debatable what
this means, but it is the basis for presenting the triumph of nature
over nurture.  
</p>
<p>A kiss is just a kiss&hellip;?</p>
<p>Like many film of this type it is
ultimately rendered uninteresting by its intrinsic mechanicality.  A
slasher vampire or zombie movie is enjoyable in its mechanistic
working through of permutations of death.  But these movies generally
avoid inventing formed characters to whom the viewer can assign
markers of an assigned individuality.  Evelyn Stoker is such a
character in Stoker, supposedly the widow of Richard (there is a case
that Charlie and Richard are split personalities of the same man) and
mother of India.   P lavishes his movie with an opening relationship
between Evelyn and Charlie, but then the script reveals this
relationship is really a cover for the hard on that Charlie in fact
has for India.  We gaze upon this reciprocated revealed incestuous
relationship, as does Evelyn who witnesses a deep French kiss between
the niece and uncle (father?). When Charlie realises he has been seen
with his tongue down India's throat, he tries to divert Evelyn into
dropping her guard, by making an immediate play for her (before
admittedly strangling her with his strap).  Now this play for Evelyn
is led with his tongue, which he extrudes and is eagerly gobbled 
down by Evelyn, who sinks to the ground under the passion of
Charlie's hot kiss.  At this point we enter pantomime land, the never
never land of the mechanicality of the film maker.  Charlie can drop
Evelyn's knickers, pant on her, but he cannot kiss her on the mouth
with his mouth still dripping with India's saliva.  The film dies
back at this point.</p>
<p>Park seems well out of his cultural
depth with Stoker.  It is made with a eye to stringing together a
series of arresting arbitrary images to make a piece of gothic
americana that he does not really understand.  He did this sort of
thing better in Korea where he understood better the transgressions
and cultural parameters needed pull of this kind of movie. In the USA
he only succeeds in making another weird deterritorialised movie.
