<p>What a carry-on.</p>

<p>J G Ballard’s work is a grounded writing project of
observation and analysis that is guided by metaphysical speculations.In Ballard’s work it is his characters state
of mind and speculative psychology that interpret structures and events
generated by the built environment.The
Ballard characters understand life as a rhizome of interconnected abstract
forces that shape and mould their destinies.His work is a virtual dissection ofmodernism probing through the skin of contemporary life in order to expose
a collective para-sympathetic nervous system as it responds and adapts to the
provocations of the new order;a thought
experiment that tests the careers of physical bodies and their prosthetic extensions
into cars airplanes hermetically sealed structures and media.The novels record new connections and paradigms
of psychic possibilities in response to the changing order of existence.</p>

<p>For Ballard it is not so much that the traditional drives
governing human behaviour havechanged.Rather that they are warped and distorted and
cannibalised by the new parabolic connections and geometries of modern living.In the
actual novel High Rise, Wilder speculates whilst he and one of the continuity
girls from the studio are making love.He imagines that if they were interrupted, that on resumption of their
enjoyment she would pick up perfectly from the place where they had left off,
recalling every one of their gestures thrusts caresses and kisses that had
proceeded the interruption. Or in Love and Napalm USA the character equates the
bend of a elevated highway with the inner curve of Jackie Kennedy’s thigh,
linking them in a future of blood caked deaths.
</p>

<p>Ballard doesn’t do characters so much as types or
occupations.In effect all his
characters are introjected self imaginings of states of consciousness moulded
by an outer function: the cost accountant, the orthodontist, the airline pilot.</p>

<p>None of this is easy starting point for film.</p>

<p>Film doesn’t do metaphysics easily.Goddard and Tarkovsky have in different ways
produced wondrous movies with a metaphysical core, as have Hitchcock and Mackendrick.
But these film makers all knew what
they were about, understood the types of statements they were making. In the hands of Ben Wheatley and his script
writer Amy Jump, High Rise turns to metaphysical dust.Unable to transpose these projected abstractions
onto the screen, Wheatley is left with a setting, a couple offamiliar ideas, situations and
characters.The resultant mix comes out
situation and character dominated which lumps High Rise into a sort of
sub-genre Ealing Comedy, driven by familiar British class oppositions
intermixed with a dystopian Lord of the Flies play out. </p>

<p>High Rise’s recreation of the high rise structure is the one
element of the film that works visually to define the concrete mausoleumenvisaged by Ballard.But the problem is what is happening inside
this wonderfully conceived digital edifice?Orgies?</p>

<p>This unknowing ofwhat it is that is happening inside the tower dogs High Rise.It is a potpourri of different inputs that are
mixed together in increasing desperation.We have a couple of ideas, the symbolic acting out of class conflict in
the maw of the tower, the idea of atavistic reversion, but the expression of
these ideas is mediated through the expressive device of the British eccentric,
the character actor expert at delivering the cameo role.Eccentricity replaces metaphysics as the
film’s conceptual resource.Besides the
setting of the tower, there are significant subsettings within its carapace:
individual apartments, corridors, lifts, the stairwell. Wheatley uses these subsettings for events, and
the main type of event in High Rise is the orgy.</p>
<p>The orgy is the dominant feature of the film, taking up a
lot of its footage.Perhaps Wheatley
felt orgies were metaphors for the idea of degeneration, perhaps he felt the
audience would be titillated gazing at the sexual posturings of actors body
doubles and extras.The duration of the
orgy scenes points to directorial anxiety rather than directorial confidence,
as the orgies in themselves only incoherently fill out the screen with the
explicit rather than the implicit.</p>

<p>Ben Wheatley’s High Rise seems to me to be the very worst
sort of filmmaking. Buy a property and exploit it by filling it out with stuff
you hope the audience will buy.If it’s
a British film you don’t need to worry much about the reviewers, most of them,
as part of the UK film industry, will fall in line. It’s a Film making industrial
culture encouraged by a financing system dominated by TV companies and private
finance companies.It is interesting to
note that in the film credits it is the money that comes first. Once it was the stars and actors, once it was
the tech people, now the first front credits of most films are dominated by the
production companies who have put up the finance.It seems to mean that any potential director
has to meet multifarious and perhaps conflicting demands from all the ‘interested’
parties, before they can even begin to want to understand their material.</p>
