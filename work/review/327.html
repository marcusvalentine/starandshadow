<p>Robert Bresson Season fall 2012,  at Star and Shadow - an overview</p>

<p>Film screened: Les Dames de Bois de Boulogne (1945) , Au
Hazard Balthazar (1966), Mouchette (1967), L’Argent (1983)</p>

<p>In the hand of Bresson mediums are the message</p>

<p>Viewing retrospectively a series of films by Bresson (RB) in
the conditions for which they were intended, in a cinema and on a large screen,
is a privileged opportunity to overview and penetrate more deeply into the
mainsprings of his filmic demiurge.</p>

<p>The films exhibited at the Star and Shadow included movies
from the beginning and end of his directing career, and two from the mid period
of his output.</p>

<p>The first film shown at the Star and Shadow was RB’ssecond film, Les Dames de Bois de
Boulogne.I think it is a
disaster, but seen in light of his subsequent output it was a disaster from
which he learnt and which revealed for him the only path that he could
take:To thy own self be true. </p>

<p>‘Dames…’is a
film that has nothing to do with RB’s primary desire as director. “Dames…’
looks like a hard learnt lesson as to what happens when an artist betrays
himself for the sake of the usual mess of la-la potage: image - recognition -
flattery = death of self. You get to work with cultural greats like Cocteau,
beautiful actresses like Maria Casares you become one of us and presumably get
paid but you pay a price: the destruction of spirit.For some that’s a reasonable compact: but not for RB.</p>

<p>RB determined to live and work FROM THIS POINT on his own
terms. ‘Dames…’ is Cocteau’s script; it is Cocteau’s film.It is Cocteau’s transposed revisitation
of an old mythic theme, the revenge of the Queen on the Night (death) on the
Life impulse.Costumed with sets
and acting tuned into high opera this is Cocteau’s world of phantasmic
yearnings finding form in film.It
bears no relation to the concerns of RB:the earth and its substrate, the human situation and the conditions of
life, which RB grounds not in Cocteau’s parallel worlds, but in the everyday,
in rural or urban settings, amongst those who struggle to survive and whose
daily decisions always have to have an element of primal calculation.</p>

<p>It is the expressive style of his actors that governs the
affects RB educes in his movies.I think that the performances RB elicits from his actors make them into
mediums through which the audience are able to see the situations that the
films present.BR’s actors are
signs pointing the audience to social relations;BR’s actors are not signifiers for the viewers empathic
relations.Of course this does not
mean that a viewer cannot have an empathy with Mouchette or Balthazar; only
that such empathy is not grounded in the image but in the viewer.</p>

<p>BR’s actors do not mimic or imitate or use gestures and
other physical expressive responses that excite the emotions.RB asks his actors to acknowledge and
giverecognition to the situations
in which the scenario locates them.The actors are mediums, channels for theconduction of the implications of situations and ensuing
events; they are conductors through whom the audience experiences what is
happening.RB believes that
responses lie in the viewer’s domain of understanding.In RB’s films, the viewer is not given
a ride to vicarious emotional involvement, a shortcut to affective indulgence.</p>

<p>The stoic and disciplined use of this acting technique, in
which the actors do not put out, is characteristic feature of Balthazar
Mouchette and L’Argent.In
relation to the cognitive and emotional in the films there are only our
meanings, the understanding we chose to read.This is exemplified of coursein the character of Balthazar the donkey. In the film he is
a link between the different orders of human experience, a sort of foil to
Marie’s course through life in the same village. Balthazar as a link is a
construct through whom we can understand: cruelty, betrayal, sadness,
desperation, neglect.But BR also
points to perhaps strangely, a certain lyricism in life and in death.In the final scene of Balthazar the
donkey finds death in the mountains lieing down to meet die in what we can
understand as a sort of bucolic peace. This scene works because by this time,
as with Mouchette who also dies a choreographed lyrical death, we understand
that both Balthazar and Mouchette are constructs with who in the course of the film
we the viewers, have had to form our own particular relation.</p>

<p>Of course RB’s situational acting, perhaps hard to accept
even at the time that the films were made,is even the more so now. Some of the audience coming out of
the films immediately commented on the ‘bad acting.’ Which is of course not the
point, but also there were viewers who had seen beyond the acting into the
layers that RB lays down in his films for the viewer to penetrate through his
mediums.</p>

<p>My feeling on viewing Balthasar Mouchette and L’Argent is
that Bresson was not much interested in narratives, so much as with situations
and conditions.The conditions he
was concerned with were those of human commerce in its broadest sense.Our being in the world which forms our
relations.</p>

<p>His settings
revolve about the material interchange which charactises life: shops, bars,
smugglers, small time dealers, tenants and landlords all are forced into
intercourse with each other.Exchange intercession sex drink work tending buying selling robbing
thieving smugglings illness are conditions within which situations arise.
Within these situations, events occur which have their own ‘life’ a ‘life’
powerful enough to overtake the characters.And in this commerce between people it is the hand to which
the attention of RB is drawn.The
hand, that busy dealing appendage, that when ‘events’ take over, has a mind of
its own.</p>

<p>In RB films it is his hand at work and it is always the hand
we see.The hand that grasps grabs
caresses soothes holds pushes beats laments.The hand takes on its own imperative. The connection made by
hand action repeats as a key motif through RB’s work.The hands at the ATM, the teacher’s hands on the keys of the
piano, the hands that set lures, the hands that whip.When the hand leads ‘life’ becomes strangely connected.Through the hand thesituations engender events that
defy the logic of normal relations. The logic is notnarrative in a psychological sense, it is the connective
movement of the hand which shapes destiny. The burglar who on entering a house
sees an axe and decides on impulse to wait for the householders to return and
kill them.Just a connection.That is the dynamic RB engages. </p>

<p>What stops RB’s films being without hope, and generally if
you look qt the sequence of situations and events there is a feeling that the
characters are sliding into helpless and hopelessness, is simply the acting
style. Balthazar, Marie, Mouchette, Yvon are connective devices through whom
the audience is linked to their being in the world.Without emotional expression (OK Mouchette does cry, but why
does she cry?) it is we who are confronted with the condition of the world and
the hope if we look for it is only to be found within us, the viewer as a seer.
