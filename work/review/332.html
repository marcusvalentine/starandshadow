<p>Foxfire  Laurent Cantet  (2012 USA) 
Raven Adamson, Tamara Hope</p>
<p>Viewed:  Cinema at Villette Paris  
Ticket: Euro10.50</p>

<p>On the right to choose.</p>

<p>This is the second time Joyce Carol
Oates' novel Foxfire (FF) has been filmed, first time was in 1999.  I
haven’t seen the first film adaptation or read the novel which is
set during the ‘50’s in small town upstate New York, the sort of
community familiar to Joyce Oates from her own upbringing.  It is a
location that will not be familiar  to Laurent Cantet (LC) from his
upbringing, but to a limited extent, the setting and situations dealt
with are perhaps familiar territory from his previous movie Entre
deux Murs, which also adapted a biographical novel and dealt with the
experience of a teacher in a tough deprived Parisian suburb.  But
Foxfire for me charts LCs own personal filmic journey, in which this
film maker previously concerned with narratives connected to realist
situations starts to relocate his subjects in the world of fantasy.  
In the case of FF the world of the child is remoulded outside of the
classroom of Entre deux Murs and projected onto the wish fulfilment
structure of the peer group: the girl gang.   
</p>

<p>It is my impression that in traditional
story telling, from fairy tale through 19th to mid
twentieth century narratives, the child is portrayed predominantly as
victim.  Both in fairy and in Victorian story, the child was a pawn
of the moral.  The child suffered within the strictures of its
structured relations; but the good child eventually with help from
magical creatures or the working of destiny, was restored back to the
world in its rightful place.  Children were in the worlds of Dickens
or of the Fairy Tale the object of moral and social forces that were
beyond their control;  of relations with power that were not of their
choosing.  Even Richmal Compton's creation 'William' for all his
proactive exertions, always in the end had to bow to the authority of
the adult world. 
</p>

<p>In literature and above all in film
form for some time now the child has been recast as the active
protagonist.  The child is no longer victim but a player.  Like the
action hero the child is author of its own fate. In a sense the child
is accorded full rights to a fantasy existence which is in accord
with the consumer ideological ideal of always being able to choose. 
It is an ideological imperative of this right that the dream of the
child should conform to the adult world view: the contemporary
Weltanschauung.</p>

<p>The mapped out possibility of the child
being enabled to exert influence over the world as a fantastic realm,
is an extension of Hollywood's extension of the American Dream, which
signifies in its story lines the right of individuals to self
determination.  Contemporary films for children (which are also made
with adults as a target audience) constitute a logical extension of
this right to self determination into the domaine of the child. The
child being traditionally an agent unable to shape its own destiny,
more a pawn than a castle, becomes a mover and a shaker, a fully
fledged consumer able to live the dream able to buy and buy into the
dream.</p>

<p>As children are only active in limited
spheres of activity, mostly home and school, the film industry has
had to recast these locations as fantastic worlds in order to be able
to play out narratives of determination populated by children.  Adult
scenarios in films may be of course fantasial narratives but
realistic settings provide a structural framework holding the self
evidential nature of the fantasy in check.</p>

<p>Films featuring child protagonists and
set in the world of the child, are located either in straightforward
magical  parellel worlds as seen in the Harry Potter series; or as in
the case of FF, the setting and story are retrojected back in to hazy
past, such as the '50's that is familiar but different.  This setting
with its locations props and costumes are authentic up to a point but
can exploit the potential of anachronistic attitudes in the children.
 This allows contemporary attitudes to sport themselves, particularly
in dialogue, giving cheap and easy exchange victories to the child
protagonists. 
</p>

<p> Interestingly Harry Potter and FF
share some things in common in this process of empowerment of the
child.  Both are set in a sort of cosy past of certitude and both
employ the idea of groups of children held together by secret oaths
and the bonds of ritual.  In FF, justified by the anachronistic power
of retrospective morality, it is the gang of girls led by 'Legs' who
occupy the moral high ground and whose actions are both successful
and righteous. They live the dream of a fantasial empowerment, and
assimilating the consumer diktat: desire.</p>

<p>Whilst having a place in the developing
current ideological discourses around child  empowerment,  FF offers
nothing to film.   The camera work is superficial and adds nothing to
the film except the need to get from shot reaction shot. From one
thing to another.  The film image is flat and layered looking as it
is in many HD productions. The acting performances from the adults is
two dimensional cardboard. The script ponderous, concerned with
conveying attitude rather than state of mind, and the performances of
the girls whilst occasionally arresting, are mostly mechanical as
they plough their course through the film from event to event.</p>
