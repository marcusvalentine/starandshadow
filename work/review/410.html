<p><b><span>Viewed: Tyneside Cinema 16 Nov 2015; ticket:free screening as part of the ‘Being Human15’
festival.</span></b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><span>The last witch trial in
England</span></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><span>Michael Reeves’
Witchfinder General is another of those movies from the late 60’s and early
70’s which exploited violence as an expressive force to confront the resistance
of bourgeois sensibilities to the knowledge that the body is the ultimate site
upon which power is exercised.Perhaps
Reeves and other directors at this time were fortunate in the sense that
violence had not yet become a regular part of the cinematic diet.Violence today usually a formulaic
indulgence, the casual recourse ofdistracted entertainment; violence disconnected from the either the real
physical or from social or historical context.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>And Reeves’ film links
violence society and the flesh to a historical context with a contemporary
reference.Society for different kinds
of reasons: chaos, insecurity, moral collapse and breakdown, seeks out scapegoats
as: diversion, misdirection, self legitimisation.It then procedes to mark upon the bodies (or
perhaps minds) of scapegoated individual,
the signs of their transgression. A
substitute victim on whom to imprint the pain of fractured social relations. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Context: the Profumo Affair.Reeves as he wrote his script will have been
familiar (sic) with the death of Steven Ward in 1963.And this death surely fed into and helped
form some of Reeves’ ideas about the content
of his film. Steven Ward, together with
prostitute ‘witches’ Christine Keeler and Mandy Rice-Davies (the latter two as
coerced blackmailed and pilloried witnesses against Steven), were subjected to
very public trial both by gutter press, egged on and encouraged both by the
establishmen the prosecutors (witch hunters) and judiciary. Steven Ward, tortured
and shattered by the experience of his trial killed himself by taking an
overdose (some point to a more sinister agent namely MI5) whilst awaiting sentence
having been found guilty of ‘sex’ crimes.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>The whole scandal, took
place in the context of a British political and social establishment engulfed
by moral panic.Ward’s ordeal was, at
time of writing, surely the last witch trial in England.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>The form of the movie
adopted by Reeves stylistically resembles a Hammer Film production (Certainly in
relation to the interiors; some of the landscape shots are of a different
order). The rather rigid period shot ‘set ups’, the use of zoom lens for
dramatic emphasis and a mis en scene set in Olde England, with the characters costumed
up for ‘the period’ but with contemporary 60’s hair cuts.Reeves’ subverts this filmic formula by use of
scenes depicting the direct physical violence perpetrated by the witchhunters
upon their victims.The usual horror convention
was to stay true to the conventions of costume and not to include images (sound
was another matter; ref the Berberian
Sound Studio) of raw violence in films.Hence Hammer Films’ reputation for rather camp/arch theatrical horror.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Reeves’ story is real in
the sense that his main character, Matthew Hopkins was an actual witchhunter, a
bounty hunter, responsible for the deaths of many witches, nearly all women who
had ‘confessions’ extorted out of them by torture and violence. But just as to tell the story of Mandy Ian and
Christine, you have to tell the story of the body and the psychological
violence perpetrated on them by power; Reeves’ ‘witches’ are not horror
phantasms.There is a ‘moral’ purpose to show what was done to
them.Otherwise we will not get it: we won’t
see beyond the cozzies. Reeves’ shows us
the blows, the prickings, the hangings, the burning.The violence in Witchfinder General is
shocking because it has a moral purpose, that undermines the outer theatrical
form of the film.Most critics at the
time, including Alan Bennett, simply saw the film as as repugnant exercise in
sadism.A comment sufficient in itself
on the blinkered vision of the UK arts establishment at this time in relation
to British movies. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Vincent Price’s
performance in Witchhunter is extraordinary.He is chilling in delivery, discipline and diligence.The psychic immobility of his sadism creates
the image of the perfect psychopathic killing machine.As we watch his singular progress across East
Anglia, his deft insinuation of righteousness, he calls to mind with vivid
realisation the men who presided over other terror regimes. Hitler’s Stalin’s
Polpot’s and latterly the Isis’ power ultimately rested on pain
and physical degradation of the body, carried
out by men and women all the more terrifying for their cynicism and pure self
gratification justified in the name of ‘higher values.</span></p>
