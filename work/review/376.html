<p>Viewed Empire Cinema 29 April 14;Ticket: £4</p>

<p>Will the real John Locke please stand up…<span>Steven Knight
takes us into Ivan Locke’s cockpit as he drives the highways through the night
in his communication system battle truck.A bardic warrior of the 4G network taking on angels and demons in his
quest to confront and balance the forces of personal kama.Locke existing as a virtual entity, a stream
of consciousness and desire connecting him out to other actual worlds that he
trying to shape and control.The Locke Machine.</span></p><p>
</p><p>The eponymous film title taken from the name of its main
character, may point to the film’s philosophical provenance, in that this name
is shared with the seventeenth century English Enlightenment philosopher John
Locke.John Locke proposed what for the
time was a radical theory of the self, which he defined as a continuity of
consciousness.And certainly in Ivan
Locke, as in his namesake, we see a man of the Enlightenment.A being defining himself through consciousness,
and through rationality connecting to the domains of utility emotion and ethics.</p>

<p>Steven Knight sets up the situation of being in a car. The
car as a carapace for a continuous stream of conscious communication, a default
state of modern disembodied virtual existence.The disembodied virtual element also characterises the in-car monologue
Ivan directs to his dead and resented father. As well as being a device for a
emotional back story, Ivan’s ‘father monologues’ also read as an extension of
in-car communication into the land of the dead: as if death itself was no
impediment to the unending stream of communications that characterise our
existence.</p>

<p>The mobile call as an existential experience in which we are
defined by our intentions; where we are nodal points of vast nervous systems
that relay information.Ivan’s attitude
to the information that streams out of and into his vehicle validates faith in
contemporary communication systems. Like a five star general he runs his
campaigns on the assumption that his information is full and true, compounding
the idea that we can ubiquitously control manipulate and promote ourselves instrumentally
through the microwave channels.</p>

<p>The film’s plot ends with the apparent triumph of Ivan the
technocrat. The Ivan machine which he put into play has produced satisfactory
outcomes on all fronts:the practical
and the moral; and time has been bought and a position established in the difficult
dialogue with his wife.</p>

<p>As the film progresses we watch Locke cope with the stresses
invented for him by Knight.But I felt
increasingly that I was watching a sort of displaced superhero movie.The Locke machine was driven by an overcoming
script engine which displaced meaning.Locke had nothing to untangle except the knots in an external world.As the script mechanics became evident, interest
in the movie was sustained by ratcheting up of the emotional feed-back loops
that had been put into play.But for the audience the superhero scenario
left the world ofLocke’s interiority as
unmapped space. As Locke developed the
film increasingly resembled a typical Saturday night radio play, completely
reliant on melodramatics for effect. </p>

<p>The lack of interiority in the Ivan character affects the
film’s relationship with its audience. For Ivan states of questioning, doubt,
heretical thoughts, ambivalence whatever, are not present either in script or
in performance. Given the structure of the film, with its strict focus on the
Ivan machine, the audience is in a
situation where they have to come to some moral judgement about him. Psychically and operationally he is more than
protagonist, he is presence; his actions his justifications, the film. Although
the plot develops, Ivan doesn’t.The
Ivan machine does not break down.It
stays in operational mode throughout the film, so that half way through the
movie there is nothing more to see.At
this point that Ivan becomes a tired machine out of whom Tom Hardy has to try a
squeeze the last few emotional miles. The character is mono-dimensional.The Ivan machine has not one line or one
moment that challenges his dimension. In
a critical humanist sense Ivan doesn’t develop, he responds.As a result we leave the film without being
left with any perceived truth or insight; we have seen a situation that simply
demonstrates what we already know.</p>

<p>Perhaps Knight might
assert that his depiction of interiority was effected through the
exteriorities.</p>

<p>Locke is vigourously interspersed with exterior night shots
of the highways, long shots close shots of different durations.There is particular emphatic use of focus
pulls on lighting and on the refractive and reflective metal surfaces of the
motorway traffic.Now these cut away
images seem sometimes to connote symbols of chaos and confusion that we the
audience might link to some actual or deeper state of mind in Ivan.This may be the case, but the serial
repetition of these affective shots depreciates their value. They come to seem
part of the current vogue for ‘scape’ inserts into drama as a pretension of
meaning.And with so many of these
shots inserted as cut aways unlinked to any interiority in Ivan, they start to
look increasingly like distraction.</p>

<p>The positive element In Locke which pulled me in was its
initial premise: the idea of compression and the crushing of space.As time intensifies space is squeezed and
Locke opens with the interplay of the two networks that contract space to
non-existence: the wireless network and the road network.Time radically replaces distance opening up
both practical and psychic possibility in the human domain.Ivan Locke travels on two parallels of
intensity and plays them perfectly like some sort of Zen master balancing the
forces of Ying and Yang.Breathtaking
for a while but somewhere in the intermeshing of all these elements there has
to be fear, for without fear there is no meaning.</p>
