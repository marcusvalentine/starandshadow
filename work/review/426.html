<p>Rocco and his brothersLuchino Visconti(It 1960)Alain Delon, Renato Salvatore, Annie
Girardot, Katina Paxinou</p>
<p>Viewed Tyneside Cinema 16 June 2016Ticket: £8:75</p>

<p>Opera </p>

<p>From the graphic impact of the opening titles, large white
blocked out font on black which finally fades through to the great shed of
Milan’s station, this is Visconti’s opera:playing out a charged melodrama against an epic backcloth that
encompasses and contains the both the plot and state of mind of the protagonists.</p>

<p>Rocco has the veneer of a neo-realist movie but seeing past
its surface the theme of the film is not so much social but psycho-sexual.The psycho-sexual theme is located and
established within the context of an cultural matrix which gives cogency to the
idea.The issues of social relations (though
not that of migration) recede as the movie develops its real focus: the
development of new forms of personal identity grounded in the experiential conditions
of urban alienation. </p>

<p>Visconti’s narrative device of exploring the relationships
between brothers calls to mind Dostoyevsky’s Karamazov.The way in which both Visconti’s film and Dostoyevsky’s
novel render of the intensity of male relations, highlighting the the
polarisation of the spiritual and the visceral, as between Alyosha and Dmitry, and
Rocco and Simone.In Rocco and his
brothers Visconti realises a scenario of emotional and sadistic savagery as
individually Rocco and Simone strive to define who they are and come to terms
with their destinies as migrants in a new theatre of life.</p>

<p>Rocco’s family have traded: the security of slavery to the
land in the South for the insecurity of industrial life in the North; moved from a kind of primal state of innocence
to a state of sin. Once they were
figures in a landscape; now they are figures in a man made world that
overshadows them.Once they had few
desires, now they are overwhelmed by desires. </p>

<p>Visconti’s settings in Milan: the station shed, the tenement
blocks, the factories, the Cathedral, the bars and boxing arena are
architectonic stages for the playing out of the psychic saga of the Parondi
family’s deterritorialisation.Visconti exploits
the sets beyond the suggestive power of their presence.His camera tracks cranes swoops pans through
the densities of the urban structures penetrating their resistance as the
family, both as group and as individuals, are absorbed into their new
environment.An arcing crane shot tracks
the family’s arrival at their first tenement flat, glides over the exterior
wall and then follows them into the interior of their new dwelling.The complexity and unexpected movement
suggests something of the journey of the family itself; the admix of wonder and
apprehension at the new trials they face as they are swallowed down into a new
concrete world order.</p>

<p>Two of the brothers Ciro and Vincenzo are absorbed into the
mechanicality of industrial Milan.They internalise
the life of the worker trying to realise the capitalist dream, trading self and
soul for wages, freedom for a new kind of servitude, adopting the gestures and
motions ofwork.But Visconti’s focus is onRocco and Simone who dance to another urban
rhythm: the fast track.To short circuit the proletarian fate, you
take what you want using violence.The
violence that is a property of the body.In the USA the protagonists would be gangsters;in ‘Rocco’ the protagonists take up boxing. </p>

<p>Both Rocco and Simone emerge in Visconti’s movie as new
kinds of homoerotic beings. Men defining their sexuality in an environment
where the rules and roles have changed.The brothers develop as two sides of the coin of male sexuality.Simone’s drive and lust released by success
as a boxer overwhelm him; his demand is to possess women, fuck them, impose his
will on life.He is the beast who
smashes everything that gets in the way of his desire, and as he falls into a
spiral of failure and pathetic decrepitude only the delusion of being a big man
keeps him alive.Simone’s response, the
exageration of the male qualities becomes a parody of heterosexual behaviour, a
leaden barren path to death of body and soul. </p>

<p>Rocco takes a different path. Visconti marks his film with a
number of powerful close up’s of his main characters.The most potent of these affect images
spliced into the film are those of Alain Delon who plays Rocco.The close-up’s of Rocco’s are visually
stunning.They are moments of stillness
that immediately absorb the viewer into a face that resonates with a pure
beauty, a suggestion of a more diffuse male sexuality, an androgynously forming
identity, a psyche alert to the possibilities of sensualities outside the
bounds traditional relationships.It is
in his use of these defining close-ups as much as in the action that Visconti
shapes Rocco’s development.Rocco is the
other, the saint like figure who though immersed in a twisted world wants to
try and help, even if he is confused, doesn’t know how to and his actions
contradictory and are in vain.Rocco
fuses both male and female identity in both his actions and body.</p>

<p>It is this clash between Simone’s assertion of an identity built
on purely male attributes, and Rocco’s movement towards an androgyny, that in
opposition legitimises the extreme episodes ofsadistic sexual violence that are resolving mechanisms in the film,
allowing us to see clearly what is happening.Simone’s vicious rape of Nadia and beating of Rocco are staged as grand
opera: we see small figures against large backcloths.It defines and clarifies the emotional
psychic space between the two brothers, and throws into terrifying relief the
extent to which the pure female, in the person of Nadia, has become simply a
pawn in a game she cannot control.A
game which is played out to the bitter end in the penultimate section of the
film where a demented Simone, unable to live with himself, tracks Nadia down
and in his final aria, kills her with a knife. She becomes a sacrificial
offering to Simone’s failed masculinity.</p>

<p>Visconti’s movie pulls together significant themes relating
to male relationships and male psychic adjustment.Visconti holds them together using masterfully
sure and expressive film techniques.Viewing Rocco, I felt that Scorsese and Coppola had carefully studied
Visconti’s film, for there are similar themes and techniques replicated by
them.Their settings of course are also
Italian, and Scorsese in particular in Goodfellas captures this same fetid crucible
of intense fraternal male relationships that characterise his New York
gangsters.The same sweated bodies in
undershirts play out relations in both movies.And in Raging Bull, the stunning cinematography that characterises the
fight sequences can be seen in embryonic form in Rocco.In relation to the Godfather, Coppola’s
magnificent ‘family’ epic is famous for its sequence that intercuts the
Christening in the church with the murders of the New York dons.This sequence is very similar in idea
Visconti’s intercutting of Simone killing Nadia with his knife with the joyous
event of the Parondi family celebrating Rocco’s victory.Rocco and his brothers has been a pivotal
significant film at many levels.</p>
