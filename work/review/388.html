<p>A future haunted by metaphysics</p>

<p>It’s interesting to think about Tarkovsky’s Solaris and Kubrick’s
2001.Both use the medium of sci-fi to project
their own present-day concepts onto future time.And although these films were produced some
40 years ago, the respective concerns that drove the two director/writers are
still relevant .</p>

<p>Tarkovsky’s script presents as pure allegory as he ponders
the enigma that the further we travel out of history, outside time, the more are we overwhelmed by the processes
of time, mediated through: memory reliquaries museums. The journey the Space
Station and Solaris the mysterious new planet, all elements projected outside
human history unleash the hounds of time
as living uncontrollable forces, hunting down the interiorities both ofthe cosmonauts and  of ourselves.</p>

<p>This allegorical voyage represents Tarkovsky’s
metaphysical understanding of the place of time in Soviet Russia.Since the November 1917 revolution, history
as a living force, had been abolished by the USSR, replaced by the chrono-mechanics
of the Communist Party.So Soviet Russia
was unable to respond, except with regimented suppression, when the forces of
history inexorably returned to haunt the land its leaders and its people.Solaris is a pure psycho-metaphysical
contemplation of time/history that<span>  imprints</span> itself on the film with increasing weight as the scenario unravels.What are understood at first as
separate presences, phantoms that are different to and alien to us, finally
reveal themselves as being our own mirror like reflections.The metaphysical insight of an eternal
recurrence that we shall return to haunt ourselves. </p>

<p>Kubrick’s 2001 comes from an entirely different direction.The central pillar of Kubrick’s thinking in
2001 is the control of humanity by mysterious exteriorised entities.2001 looks at this through both cosmic and
social frames.It is the social frame, projected through
advanced intelligence technology, that is the most successful.Although Kubrick always talked about making a
movie about Artificial Intelligence, 2001 is his AI movie.(His failure to make
another AI movie may simply reflect that in 2001 Kubrick had said all he had to
say about this idea, remembering that power relations were a core concern of
this director) </p>

<p>The most successful sections of 2001 posit a spaceship world
controlled by AI.Actually this clean
hi-tech world wonderfully anticipates the products and ethos of Apple Inc. Kubrick’s
spaceship sequences with the wonderful clean lines of the sets complementing the
soothing ingratiating voice of HAL, feels like it seduces as much as serves the
crew (and the viewers) with its expression of a certain techie perfection.
Kubrick’s Discovery 1suggests, like Steve Jobs, (who would have been 13 at
the time of the release of 2001) an encompassing corporate concept: products
built with powerful operating systems, designed with intuitive controls and built with the consumer in mind. In fact when I think about it there was
something of HAL in the way Steve presented himself.Products that seduce.But what seduces can also betray.So the saga of the betrayal by Hal of his
human charges is the central drama that grips the movie.And this betrayal stands as Kubrick’s
sharpest insight into the the core problems of technology and AI.The more we trust and the more we try to build
into our systems safeguards against betrayal, the more are we vulnerable.No current film maker to my knowledge has
penetrated this proposition in relation to our current technology.And where might we be lead? To the
sacrificial stone of our own collectove hubris?</p>

<p>As for Kubrick’s cosmology?It is vacuous.Despite starting
with huge promise with the type of image fusion that only film can make:
between Dawn Men with their the discovery of weapons and projectiles leading to
Techman and Space Flight. The connection is magnificent expressed through a
majestic cut. An idea of human development is linked
to the appearance of a Dolmen at the Dawn of Man sequence and mankind’s subsequent movement into out of planet earth into space.Kubrick implies a destiny for man
shaped by another mysterious realm of intelligence. As long as this is left
vague, it is Ok as a story driver.</p>

<p>As the theme is persued by Kubrick in the latter stages of
the film, a terrible vacuity opens up as you realise Kubrick has nothing to say
beyond the truism that life is an enigma.Kubrick tries to substitute his ‘nothing to say’ by overwhelming us with
images that appear to have meaning but in fact have none. When Bowman leaves
the spaceship he is first sucked into a psychedelic tunnel warp, designed to
overwhelm our visual sense, which
deposits him in a room where he experiences Shakespeare’s Ages of Man. The
problem is that is doesn’t signify anything beyond a desperate attempt to end
the movie on a significant image: the embryo floating through space. The problem
is it has no significance,The embryo
has no referents, no grounding in the earlier part of the film. It is just a
floating empty image. A testimony to Kubrick and Clark’s failure to resolve
their material. But then metaphysics never was either Kubrick or Clark’s strong
point.</p>

<p>One thing for certain, Solaris Station could never be
mistaken for a product conceived by Steve Jobs. It does not have that Apple
look.It looks tired, as tired and used as the civilisation that
built it.It bears the marks of its own
history, scuffed dirty litter strewn,
mired in time. Whereas Discovery one is a linear structure, an arrow pointing
at a target, Solaris Station is circular, those who live there doomed to  circulatory, of meeting themselves as they try to escape from
themselves. Decked out with the arbitrary trinkets of history, Solaris Station
is in itself a time trap, locked into geostationary orbit over a terrifying
plastic lake that feeds back only memories.</p>

<p>And it is this plasticity of time that marks out the
ultimate vision of Solaris. As the lake gurgitates into vision a replicant of
the home farm where the film begins (shot with visually suggestive fluidity)
the realisation is that the significance of Tarkovsky’s film is as an allegory.We are critically lost in time.If we are cut off from the mechanism clock
and calendar, we have no temporal anchorage.Theactual and the hallucination
start to elide and merge.As the home
farm emerges out from the waters, we understand that the imputed events of the
film may be only a cycle of repetitions.What we thought was a beginning was only the illusion of a
beginning.We have lost the means of
penetrating our realities, and like the Soviet Union, we too perhaps, the
European West, are about the learn the lesson of Solaris.</p>
