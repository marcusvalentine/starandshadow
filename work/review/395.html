<p><span>Force Majeure (Turist)  Ruben Ostlund  (Swe; 2014)
Johannes Kuhnke; Clara Wettergren</span></p>
<p><span>Viewed: Tyneside Cinema;  30 April 2015; Ticket £8.50</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Postcard from IKEA</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Sweden used to be cinematically defined by the films of
Ingmar Bergman.  Dark nights, vigils of God abandoned individuals, the
impossibility of communication, often set against untamed moody seas. This
notion of Sweedishness complemented perhaps by Volvo cars has, as Ostlund
realises, long ceased to have any contemporary resonance.  Today Sweden
has  IKEA with its big idea of tasteful design endlessly replicated in a
thousand settings.  IKEA’S walk through spaces are now a force in themselves
conditioning the sensibilities of the Middle Class experience. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>In Force Majeure (FM) the proposition of design forces
shaping consciousness, is an idea that is filmically put to the test.  A
sort of thought experiment if you like.  Necessary because IKEA has
conquered the world.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>The active dynamic of FM is not so much the characters (Ebba
and Tomas) or the plot but the backgrounds against which they are depicted.
 The film comprises series of interiors and mini settings that might have
come from any IKEA store on any continent.   It is these background
‘installations’ that condition the reactions of the actors to the script’s
 provocation: <b><i> </i></b>Tomas’ abandonment of his family at
a moment of danger and his refusal to admit to his behaviour.  </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span> Ostlund’s camera is his main forensic device,
presenting Tomas’ behaviour against the smooth surfaces of the resort
hotel.   The camera suggesting in the way it frames the action that
the ethos of modern IKEA design. and contemporary shifts in the values underlying
Western personal relationships, are wired into the same circuitry.  </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span> Like Ozu,  Ostlund uses his camera to frame
areas.  He employs the still frame as his main type of camera shot, within
which and through which we see the movement image.  However whereas Ozu’s
‘ still frame’  captures screens and bamboo woven walls, the closed- off
sight lines that characterise Japanese culture, Ostlund’s still frames capture
the open plan nature of IKEA life.  The sight lines in IKEAland are wide;
an environment where everything is seen.  Like Ozu’s closed off spaces,
the open  spaces which are the focus of Ostlund’s camera weave their own
mesh of influence over the actors.  The openness of these IKEA zones 
places everyone in full view of everyone else, everyone is on show, adults and
children alike.  The hotel with its long corridors open to gaze, the hotel
suite with its bed area, with its eating area, its bathroom area all these
spaces exert a sort of imperative cultural gravity towards conformity and consensus
in relations and in behaviour.  The uniform nature of design conditioning
a uniformity in response by the actors, the open spaces conditioning a fear of
oppositions and a gravitational pull towards consensus </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Particularly interesting in FM are the scenes set in the
‘his and hers’ en suite bathroom.  Filmed in the vast mirror against a
dark jade background Ebba and Tomas brush their teeth in their individual
basins with their individual electric toothbrushes.  Lars von Trier might
have shown the couple fucking, but the toothbrush shots say more about
their  relationship then sex.  They have left the domain of the pure
physical body and now occupy a zone characterised by shared automated
gestures.  They perform a mechanical soulless duet that celebrates their
IKEA identity which has  replaced the old opposition of raw sex.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>If IKEA conquers the world  it does so in the sense
that it becomes a conscious type of choice for a certain class or  strata
of people who seek to define their lives not through oppositions but through
something we might call consensus.  IKEA’s design and graphic
constructions represent a decontextualisation of history.</span></p>
<p><span>IKEA design (ditto Apple design) bypasses history social
cultural ethnic and race divisions, all the messy stuff, with something that
appears to come out of a hat from nowhere.  Pure techno products
unreferencing of anything but themselves. IKEA artefacts, like Apple products
 blue jeans and T shirts  are the products for those who embrace a
'silicone identity', living out careers ( not lives)  detached from the
old analogue oppositions.  The relationship between products and
constructed environments is locked into circuitry that reinforces a continuous
loop of mutual product /identity affirmation.  And the reward for staying
in the Ikea /Apple consumer loop is to become a tourist.
 Decontextualised, de-gendered  the person/consumer is free to live
like a tourist.  Free from history and culture, free to roam the earth,
 guided and hooked up through the mobile phone in a constant stream of
information.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>And it is interesting to see that Ostlund’s own title for
the film is: ‘Turist’ (Tourist).  The title FM foisted on the film by its
UK distributors points to what is ephemeral in the film, the phantom
avalanche.  Ostlund’s title Turist points to what is essential to the
film.    The intrapenetration of desire and design to create a
strata of tourist people.  A people living in one domain a consensual
domain where space is abolished not just by acceleration,  but by the rendering
of all environments as consensually equivalent and similar.  Environments
 are built so that oppositional realities are engineered out of them, so
that they always comprise familiar non conflicting representations of reality.
 </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>And for  the new tourist, nature herself must ideally
be conformed to the same ethos that defines built structures.   The
forests and woods must look wild but have safe paths and sanctuary.  The
mountain sides which are the specious object of the tourists’ visit must look
white and wild but conform to the moulding of the ski industry which lights
them up, sanitises them, builds natural looking dwellings in the valleys and
 covers the slopes with mechanical contrivances for effortlessly lifting
the tourists up.  The IKEA impulse now transforms nature which becomes an
extension of the en suite twin bathroom.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>So the world reconfigures itself according to the tourist
gaze which demands nothing less than benign detachment of their career from the
actual.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span> In FM Ostlund points up the dangers of the new ethos
  A ethos based on self referencing de contextualisation of the world
sets up a self reinforcing and amplifying circuit of consensus.  But if
oppositions arise this type of consensus culture may be critically unprepared
and too inexperienced to meet this kind of problem. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Japan’s model prewar society based on partitions and
compartmentalisation represented in Ozu’s filmic projections of a world of
screens and woven bamboo, created a cultural dis-connected state of mind that made
it possible for Japan to embrace the madness of brutal war and visious
colonialisation.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Threatened by a phantom avalanche, Tomas abandons his family
to save him own skin.  And then denies it.   Was his failure to
admit to what he did,  conditioned by the IKEA installations in which he
lives? Is his inability to admit to his act of omission  directly caused
by the amplification consensus circuitry of  this homogenous
environment?  The tourist defined by conventional gesture  and
consensus forgets the    the reality of opposition  Tomas
could only recognise behaviour in himself that accorded with the IKEA
consensual world in which he lives.  And Ebba struggles with the same
problem. She cannot initially cope with the discordance provoked by oppositions
raised by Tomas. Slowly Ebba summons up the will  to shift the IKEA
furniture and challenge Tomas.  But the process is difficult. The
furniture is big and heavy and when she finally moves it, it falls on
Tomas.  He floods out, unable to handle oppositional stress.  So Ebba
replaces the furniture and the IKEA equilibrium is restored.  The problem
of opposition unresolved. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>In the penultimate sequence Ebba and Tomas leave the ski
resort as tourists. But in the final sequence something happens.  Ebba
frightened by the manoeuvres of the bus driver, demands to be let off the bus
mid way down the mountain road. The fellow travellers, bar one, follow her off
the bus. The final shot of the film is this group of de-bussed tourists,
 walking long ways down the road.  They look like they have escaped
from a Lars von Trier film like the Idiots.  But they haven’t .
 Perhaps Ebba has learnt the wrong lessons from Tomas’ oppositional
crisis, and is now fatally overreacting becoming an Idiot striding
meaninglessly towards engagement with false oppositions.  </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>The IKEA effect de-intensifies and mutes the experience of
life.  But it becomes a source of danger when situations arise that it can
no longer contain. Wild energies.</span></p>
