<p>Andrei RublevAndrei
Tarkovsky (USSR 1966 + general consideration of Solaris, Mirror, Stalker)
Anatoly Solonitsyn</p>
<p>Viewed Tyneside Cinema 18 Sept 2016; ticket: £9:25</p>

<p>bell ring</p>

<p>A talk with my friend Ana Marton helped to clarify my
understanding of what was central to Tarkovsky’s thinking in making
Rublev.The key to understanding is
surely the relation between the allegorical opening sequence of Andrei Rublev
and the main body of the film which although dressed up as an historical drama
set in fourteenth century Russia presents a striking analogy of the turbulent destructive
forces released by the 1917 revolution that convulsed and tore up the country.The Soviet authorities were sufficiently
alarmed by the analogous parallels suggested in Andre Rublev to effectively
censor the film in the USSR where it was allowed very few screenings.</p>

<p>The opening sequence, a sort of filmic preface, comprises an
attempt made by a man (an individual never identified, a type perhaps) to fly,
to be released like a bird in the air. This man uses a sort of balloon
technology, and despite the attempt of an alarmed mob to prevent him taking
off, succeeds in launching himself from the tower and becoming airborne. “ O my
God I’m flying!” he calls out.The flight does not last long, and he quickly
crashes back down to the earth. </p>

<p>The man’s flight through the air can be understood, like Daedalus
and Icarus’ flights, as an individuated action, a man claiming the power of
birds and gods: act of hubris. </p>
<p>The idea of flight has always had a strong spiritual
connotation. Tarkovsky seems to be
pointing out that ‘flight’ in this context is an individual solution to
spiritual problems, employing a leap of faith to claim a domain that cannot be
sustained, reliant on technology not on human attributes.</p>

<p>Spiritual life is about acts of faith not leaps of faith.</p>

<p>In contrast Andrei Rublev follows a long tortuous path
through social upheaval and war that almost destroys his spirit, before finding
his faith in action.Following the
preface, the main body of the film,divided into 8 chapters, chronicles Andrei Rublev’s path through
history.Unlike flight, with its sudden
ecstatic moment Andrei’s journey is in effect a passion ( the film in Russian
was also called ‘The passion according to Andrei), in the Christian sense of
the word.A series of experiences that
challenge his spiritual being, a process
of suffering that is a total test of faith.Andrei Rublev’s faith is broken
by living in an world characterised by cruelty, violence, bodily afflictions
and betrayals.He is reduced to being
mute, spiritually exhausted, unable to paint, his faith a hollow kernel without
a seed. He is without voice retreating into isolation. </p>

<p>And then comes the bell.The voice of the Bell.The bell
has been ordered by a Count.But the
wars exterminations epidemics famines have killed or scattered those who knew
how to caste bells.The knowledge of how
to fashion bells out of the matter found in the earth is lost.But a young boy, son of a dead master bell
founder, reveals that his father had taught him the secret of bell making.With this secret knowledge the bell can be
made.The whole community come together
as one to realise the huge undertaking of casting the bell: retrieving ‘lost’
knowledge, working with energy joy common purpose, sacrificing their
individuality to the collective good. The bell becomes a collective statement of spiritual
purpose.</p>
<p>The bell is fashioned.Together the people have made a bell whose note will sound out across
the land.Together they have made it
under the direction of young boy who is barely more than a child.The child as he walks away with Rublev
suddenly admits to Rublev that his father had never told him the secrets of bell
making; his father had died before he could share his knowledge.His claim to have the secret had been an act
of faith.Faith in the forces of life.</p>

<p>At this revelation Andrei Rublev finds the path to the
deeper understanding that will enable him to start painting again.He understands faith for him is about
allowing his gift to find expression in the world.His refusal to paint had become an indulgence
of his subjective need, the break through was to see others needs, to allow his
painting to flow out. Faith is realised and
put to the proof through action.</p>

<p>Andrei Rublev with
its analogous historical referents and its allegorical opening sequence is a
spectacle. As film it adds nothing to
cinema in itself, a series of images that the viewer watches and may or may not
read meaning into. Superbly shot and directed, Andrei Rublev is an epic movie
made in the fashion of D W Griffith rather than Sergei Eisenstein.A periodically sequenced realisation of a
historic period of Russian history and its people interspersed with the
constants of earth water and fire that evoke the underlying perception of a
land of faith.This epic quality which points
directly to image also characterises Ivan’s Childhood;and it’s a quality that distinguishes
Tarkovsky’s two early films from his later productions.</p>

<p>In the three laterfilms produced and shot in the USSR, the
difference is in the position in which the viewers find themselves.Ivan and Andrei are linear movies.We are
watchers. We watch the progress of the protagonists, reading into the
development of the symbolic moving images that deepen our understanding of what
is depicted.In Solaris Mirror and
Stalker we are ‘see-ers’.The films work
by absorbing the viewer in to worlds that are at variance from everyday logic,
films that are founded in cinema logic.The
films can only be seen if the viewer enters into the psychic world suggested by
the form structure and content of each of these films.</p>

<p>Solaris Mirror Stalker demand of the viewer that they
recalibrate state of mind as they move into the world of the film.The pacing of the films, allows for mediation
of this process which works dynamically with the audience who have to engage by
defining and understanding for themselves the aqueous world in which they are
submerged.Aqueous because in all of
Tarkovsky’s movies water/fluid is a key medium whether it be: still stagnant
down pouring flowing renewing reflecting refracting. Water/fluid is ubiquitous, both in picture and
sound, omnipresent like time which also is a focal concern of Tarkovsky’s.Time always a mirror reflecting back image.Time also an idea which in these three last films
made in Russia was the basis for Tarkovsky’s personal political critique of
dialectical materialism as a dead-end Soviet theory that insisted on ‘history’
as a didactic linear time scale. Tarkovsky’s explores time as a fluid experience, an envelope of Einsteinian space/time which
wraps traps zaps us in waves and vectors of psycho/spiritual entanglement.Time as human dimension not a mechanism.</p>

<p>Mirror with its layered time structure probing personal
history and a Nietschian eternal recurrence. Solaris with its temporal
instabilities inducing the past to return to the present. Stalker with its zone containing
spacio/temporal distortion and room of desire.Tarkovsky creates worlds that have to entered by specific psychological
portals an entering that involves a surrender to the logic of the film. </p>

<p>It is Tarkovsky’s achievement as producer/director that he
had the courage of his personal and political vision to refuse compromise with
Goskino and instead to produce a series of films completely radical in their use of the
medium to do what cinema rarely does: create a new concept of what is possible.
