<p>MFritz Lang (Ger
1931 script Thea von Harbou)Peter
Lorre; Otto Wernicke</p>
<p>Viewed Tyneside Cinema 25 Sept 2014; matinee screening
ticket: £5.50</p>

<p>Retrocrit: Sound of silence</p>

<p>Although M is described as a film about the serial killer of
little girls, Lang’s movie comes across as something more than this. German playwrights
Brecht and Wedekind had already established murder as a type of idea, murder as
a relevant theme for probing the underbelly of society’s moral structure.The abandoned the mutant the criminals and
the insane, collectively could be seen as a distorted mirror through which the
distorted social and moral values of industrial capitalism could the better be
discerned.</p>

<p>Outcastes were a parody of the institutions that feared and
despised them, and from which they were banned.The slaughter of the innocent little girls is never represented as
anything other than horrific but is never exploited for melodramic charge.Lang’s bold stripped filmic statements need
no emotional intensifiers. Lang creates the
images:the shadows and shadow play, the
child’s balloon caught in telephone wires;Hans walking calmly by with his little victim Elsie. Shots that cut to
the quick of murders that are never seen and which it is not necessary to see
because Lang and von Harbou have woven the horror on the ordinary loom of
life:the everyday. </p>

<p>M’s scenario is highly contextualised. Just as the English
crime thriller often had a generic upper class setting, Lang’s movie is set
within the world of the little people: working class. The long panning opening
shot of the tenement courtyard with children playing a song game whose words
call up the child murderer, introduces a place where children occupy a
different world from adults, unchaperoned and vulnerable.It’s a culture of hard work where children are
left to fend for themselves - a recognisable feature of all European countries
at this time.The victims are working
class, as is Hans who preys on them.Hans
understands the weaknesses to which they are exposed and how easily they are
lured,The formal juxtaposed linkages
between the shots that express class experience and the actions of the murderer
suggest a Brechtian ethos working and guiding M which shapes and carries it
foreword to its next stage of development. </p>

<p>The usurpation of power by the underworld.The victory of the gangsters.</p>

<p>As the police investigation stalls and their activity
interferes with criminal enterprise, the gangsters take on the task of tracking
down M.When M was being made in 1930
Germany experiencedthe huge surge in
Nazi popularity culminating in their triumph in the 1930 elections.The characteristic features of their irresistible
rise were violence anti Semitism and pack organisation.They
understood the fears of the little people. And as a parallel psychic track, M can be read
as Lang and von Harbou’s scripted analogy of the rise of Hitler.The gangsters and crooks take over.Riding on the back of the innocence and fear
of the working class, the little people, they organise and justify taking power
and justice into their own hands.</p>

<p>The key moment in this analogous parallelism is the chalk
branding of Hans with the M sign on the back of his coat, so that he will be
recognised as the Murderer.The crude M
eerily pre-empts the Star of David and Juden badge that a few years later the
Nazi’s obliged all Jews to wear.So that
they would bare witness on their bodies the sign of their stigma.This moment of the marking of M is a stunning
coup de film that precisely points to the dialectic that works through the film.From this moment the film’s logic is turned upside down and it is this
ant-thetical logic which drives the final sections of the scenario.</p>

<p>In the first section of the film,Hans is perpetrator and hunter.From the moment of his branding, everything
changes, he becomes victim and hunted.It is a measure of Lang’s insight as a director that he understood so
clearly how to use the resources of film to create a pivotal moment from which we
start to see everything differently, to invoke a different order of
understanding.Lang and von Harbou have
already shown how society has begun break down paniced by the hunt for the child
sex killer, who could be anybody.But it
is in the mock court scene where Hans is tried by the gangsters that the reality
of mob rule is played out.</p>

<p>Legal institutions have developed over centuries to protect
everyone and to ensure that all are treated equally.The accused have to be tried by a process
which evaluates their fitness to plead.The mob sweeps this all away. Whatever you are Jew or Child Killer you
have only the right to be sentenced to death for what you are.There is a moment of pure Brechtian theatre
as Lang’s camera pans from the serried rows of gangsters baying for Hans blood
to Hans himself, alone cowered against a wooden partition.But who will speak for me, Hans asks? The
camera pans upwards now and reveals behind him, on a raised level, one of the
gangsters .He leans towards Hans and
says: that’s my job.In this shot
immediate physical threat is resolved with high farce, violence with absurdist philosophical
detachment. Extraordinary!Pure Brecht.</p>

<p>The criminal attorney conducts himself with composure and makes
an eloquent defence of Hans.He shows the
mob that terrible though Hans may be, the man is simply not responsible for his
actions.Hans cannot be guilty of
murder.Of course this plea will not
make the slightest difference to the rabble who want blood. The interaction,
the intercutting between the calm figure for the defence and the ferocity of
the mob, heightens the viewers understanding of the issues in play; we
understand at last that Hans is not guilty.However much his acts have disturbed and horrified us, we cannot condemn
him of murder.And surely the screams by
mobs of Nazis and proto Nazis calling for the death of Jews a few years later
will have stuck in the mind of some who saw M in 1931.And more than ever now we need to remember
this scene from a 1931 movie as we witness anger overwhelming judgement.</p>

<p>In this Brechtian parable we see the dialectic forces at
work shaping the film and informingour
understanding of what is happening.We
arelead first to be overwhelmed by
antagonism and fear of Hans; but these feelings are overturned by the revealed perspective that Hans is himself a
victim and needs protection from the judgement of the mob, the vectors of hate
and revenge, who exploit him for their own purposes. </p>

<p>Lang also sets a filmic dialectic to work in M. The interplayed tension between image and
sound is a characteristic of M as film experience,But for a number of sequences Lang uses no
sound, or at least only the most sparing of sound effects.Most of the film is played out with sound
where the fury of dialogue works to lead and define the images.But a number of sequences Lang plays MOS, mit
aus sound: mute. It is the most
astonishing feature of the movie.</p>

<p>When Lang like some nineteenth century magician removes the
sound (like the rabbit disappeared from the hat you wonder where it has gone)
it is as if a hole has opened up in reality.The viewer is caste down into this hole as ifexperiencing a dream. As if Lang is saying at one level, all this
life is a dream….but dream as it may be, we can still make sense of it.Lang sets us adrift in an underworld where
film and dream coalesce and into these silent images we pour ourselves.I am reminded of the mute newsreels we shall
see of the second world war.So in
silence we watch: the panic of the crowd, the anger of the gangsters, the
animal fear of Hans, the police hunt, the silence as Elsie walks away with
Hans.Silence frames these sequences.Silence frames us as we without voice cannot
speak, silence frames life and our powerlessness to act to save what needs to
be saved.Many things we watch in and
with silence, especialy evil. </p>

<p>With his use of the silent moments Lang confirms his status
not just as both a evoker of dreams but also as filmmaker who is a moralist.</p>
