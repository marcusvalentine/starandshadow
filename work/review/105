Minutes General meeting 17 December 2007 Adrin, Bill, Eftychia, Phipps, Craig, Phil, Haz, Ilana, Pauline, David, Roger.Apologies: Mat, Christo, Holly.M/AFree chairs – Craig is on the case, putting feelers out, contacted the 2 furniture coops – no chairs available at the mo but ongoing research.Bottle recycling: We have a bin – need to clarify with Alan when it is collected.Feedback from Lucero gig to Pauline: As both Pauline and Stephanie were at meeting discussion about what happened Stephanie outlined problems and there was discussion around looking after volunteers and not becoming just a gig venue again. Also that events that do turn ugly have an impact on all events – especially in the light of petition Craig mentioned - he had heard about from local residents about restricting music events here – but we need to find out more about this. Ilana’s discussion with the council is that there are no probkes they know of regarding us.Pauline described how she researchs music and is working and nurturing relationships with promoters, and aiming to talk them through contract as that seems to work better than just the text which is easy to ignore. In particular that doorstaff (ticket ones) need to be on door at all times. Also that there aren’t actually that many gigs, and reminder that so many of them are lovely events and these kind are rarer. And problematic for our venue to blanket restrict  types of music. Discussion continued about merits and problems with tightening up our structure and where we draw the line – seems that treating each case as it comes and nurturing relationships is the way forward. This needs to include SIA trained doorstaff where necessary – as we already have to on late license nights. Pauline already has a list of promoters not to invite back and ones that worked well. Craig mentioned a petition that he had heard about from local residents about restricting music events here – but we need to find out more about this, as we don’t want to be restricted in everything by one or two events. ACTION.Ilana’s discussion with the council is that there are no probs they know of regarding us.Finances:VAT report going in by end Dec. Programming: BFI issue being resolved. Bill point of contact for delivery and pick up.  2nd Feb. Ghetto Method Want to put on scenario event.   Film, music, live drawing. Needs suggestions of films for theme the devil that comes between us. Adrin – suggestion to put out email for suggestion.Phil – green festival. Meeting date wanted to confirm but issue over wiki – what happens skateboarding film hadn’t been cancelled on the wiki. Caused confusion when things cancelled but not taken off. Explained about confirmed C as discussed at programming. Reiterated that contact details are ESSENTIAL. Roger outlined issues about personal contact details. As it is too difficult for wiki not to have details, solution is for individuals to set up new/forwarding email if it’s a problem to use a main one.25th January. Green fest agm.
