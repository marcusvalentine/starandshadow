<p>Leave no TraceDebra
Granik (USA 2018)Ben Foster, Thomasin McKenzie</p>
<p>viewed Tyneside Cinema Newcastle 12 July 2018; ticket: £9.75</p>
<p> In the valley of the iPhone…</p>

<p>Leave no Trace: what does Granik’s title mean?Having viewed her movie did it point to something
about the nature of personal relations in contemporary American society: they
leave no trace? A people so self engrossed they are no longer able to have an
emotional effect upon each other, a people only able to leave a footprint in
the sand? </p>

<p>Americans (but also other Western cultures) as a people
who’s existence is marked out by a specific sort of individualism, who have
lives that comprise a series of markers: mobile phones stylistic affects
gestures trinkets and stories. Lives
defined by externalities not internalities. Lives that are present in the cloud of
knowing butleave no earthly trace.</p>

<p>The question that comes to mind is whether Granik as a film
maker functions as a passive medium a voicing for the spirits of the age?Or is she making films as a observer who sees
something about nature of contemporary relations that she wishes to
transmit.Is Granik a passive or active
agent? </p>

<p>The proposition Granik introduces is simple.A father and his daughter alone in the
world.Their journey is scripted to take
them through various experiences in various milieus: the idyll of the forest,
psycho-babble land, suburbia, and finally after some trauma, munchkin
land.Granik locates her two subjects as individuals
rather than a relational pair. Context is sketched out sparsely in the script,
just enough perhaps to give us some
bearings on father and daughter. Will is
shown to be a Vet, perhaps entitled to some support from the relevant
government agency he visits, and there is an indication that he might suffer
from PTSD.His wife and Tom’s mother
had died some time back and with his daughter he has chosen that they live a
survivalist life style out in the woods.His choice is linked to his dislike of social engagement.He prefers to be alone and bring up his
daughter Tom (Tomboy?) on his own terms. </p>

<p>When she was about nine my sister used to get a UK girl’s
comic called Bunty.Tom reminded me a
little of the heroines of the Bunty comic strips. Mostly these comic book girls were like
Tomboys: pubescent asexual decontextualized honest determined observant
achieving girls.Heroines taking on
unusual events and situations but acting out against familiar reassuring
backgrounds.Bunty heroines were ultimately
two dimensional, characters successfully designed to enrapt the attention of
its readership and provide a suitable moral role model. Granik’s Tom fits this model. We see no
internal life. With the camera regularly
pointed at her face, Tom exhibits the default expressions of contemporary
female leads, staring unyieldingly back at the director. A contemporary female construct.</p>

<p>The core of the film is a relationship between father and
daughter which is carefully depicted as low in emotional intensity. Hence perhaps Tom’s name ( a boyish moniker)
which carries no disturbing feminine resonance.In Leave no Trace this relationship is
located in place (the woods to begin with) not time (context).From the first shot of the movie (lichen
hanging off the branch of a conifer) the camera is as interested in probing the
wonders of the location as in defining the father daughter relationship at the
heart of the movie. Distraction rather
than attraction as the key to the way the scenario is played out. As if Granik’s film like a cultural filter is
a de-intensifier that neutralises ‘seeing’. </p>

<p>In Hollywood films today there is very little ‘seeing’
suggested or called up in the scripts or scenarios.By seeing I mean that the audience ‘sees’
directly what a character sees and hence interprets what is seen through direct
mediation with the material.Usually but
not necessarily, ‘seeing’ will involve shots that represent direct point of
view of a character, as well as direct voicing of the person.Films that represent seeing develop a language
of visual intelligence that exploits both scripting and camera sensitivity to
facilitate direct mediation.</p>

<p>Like Spielberg and most other Hollywood directors of this
generation, Granik is not comfortable or perhaps even interested in this type
of filmic language. In an age colonised by the image and most comprehensively overwhelmed
by a deluge of advertising messages, we are adept and more comfortable reading
signs not people.</p>

<p>So Will and Tom are filmed engaging in actions and doings
that give witness to their bond.They
feather wood to make fire, they play chess, they practice escape routines, they
prepare food, they lie next to each other at night, close but non-reactive.The inneris substituted for the the outer.Granik’s camera keeps us on the outside of the relationship. We see them
do stuff.But there is no seeing in the
film, there is no point of view from which Tom sees her Dad or her Dad sees
her. We are in a film where neither of the characters looks and sees who the other
is.They are objects to each other. Will
(sic) the father doesn’t see his daughter who she is, as a growing person,
changing all the time.Tom has no seeing
of her Dad’s pain.Closed off they don’t
see one another. In a sense although there are no iPhones in the movie, it is
as if the smart phone’s phantom cultural presence extends right into vacuum of their
relationship.A vacuum that is the
product of the culture.The iPhone is
simply a product that transposes self absorption onto the externality of a
screen information system</p>

<p>The irony is that on the terms of Granik’s script,smart phones are banished from Will and Tom’s
domain, but that the quality of their individuation depicted in the relationship,
the absence of presence, suggests each is an emptiness, an emptiness premised
on a culture that legitimises being through possession and desire. Tom’s emptiness a function of her unformed
nature; Will’s emptiness a function of
his burnt out formation.Each in their
own way is waiting metaphorically for an iPhone to fill the emptiness.Granik’s film is a coded message to the smart
phone generation, old and young: smart
phones are Ok, they are just what we have been waiting for.To fill the vacuum.</p>
