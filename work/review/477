<p>Custody (Jusqu’a la Garde)Xavier Legrande (Fr 2016)Miriam
Besson, Denis Menochet</p>
<p>viewed Tyneside Cinema 19 April 2018; ticket: £9.75</p>

<p>another advert </p>

<p>After sitting through the assault course of images designed
to sell BMW’s and other junk, the audience might have thought that when the
adverts and trailer were finished the selling shift was over and at last they
could engage with a film.But all Xavier
Legrande’s movie has to offer is another sales pitch.The product is different, perhaps
ideological, but the idea is the same: to align the presented imagery with
product.In the case of BMW it is an
object that is the product of the selected imagery; in the case of Custody it
is an objectified thought, produced through selected images.</p>

<p>I was reminded as I watched the desperate playing out of
object images in Custody of a film I had viewed earlier in the year: The Touch
by Ingmar Bergman.</p>

<p>The Touch with Bibi Anderson and Eliot Gould (Karin and
David) is not a convincing film, one of Bergman’s least satisfactory.The dialogue is leaden, there is a core of
uncertainty attaching to the direction as if Bergman lost confidence in his
material, and the characterisation is sometimes crass (Did David’s mental state
need to be explained by having relatives murdered in Nazi Death Camps? What did
Bergman think he was doing introjecting this type of determinant into his movie
script?).But whatever its
weaknesses,the Touch remains true to
Bergman’s respect for the intelligence of the audience.Bergman is not selling anything. Bergman does not make ads, he asks the
audience to think for themselves.In
contrast Legrande has little regard for the intelligence of his audience.In fact he doesn’t want the audience to think.He, Legrande, does all their thinking for
them; the audience just have to tag along on the all too predictable scripted
ride from A-B.Legrande’s BMW movie will
drive them home .</p>

<p>Both The Touch and Custody, admittedly in different
respects, have abusive behaviour at their core, but the directors’ ways of
looking at abuse are quite different.The Touch asks questions about abuse.It asks questions that touch (sic) on questionsof identity and being.Bergman’s outwardly happily married woman,
Karin, who suddenly latches onto to a relationship with a demanding violent
stranger.The Touch pitches questions
about the images that people present to the world; how appearance image can
belie being and how what is seen may be overwhelmed by what is not seen.The questions posed in The Touch, however clumsily
they may be represented are actual. Theycomport with how we experience life and people; events even when we have
experienced them may baffle us; even those we think we know well may ultimately
elude us. </p>

<p>Bergman, in The Touch for all its weaknesses, is on the side
of life.</p>

<p>Legrande’s Custody is on the side of death and dearth.</p>

<p>The death and dearth, of dialogue?Perhaps Bergman was communicating in an era
when it was possible to conceive of people able: to consider propositions that
weren’t endorsed and reinforced by ideologically closed networks; to engage in
discourses that did not have the imprimatur of someone’s idea of political
correctness.Xavier Legrande does live
in this era of boxed in communication and his movie perhaps simply reflects the
signs of the times.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the story of Miriam and Antoine and their
families, is wretched predictable fare.The old white hat / black hat story.Though in comparison even those old fashioned Westerns with men in hats
were more variegated than Legrande’s scripted inventions.Sometimes the black hats did something nice
and human, and they often had a sense of humour even if their humour leaned
towards the sadistic.</p>

<p>Custody’s black hat male, Antoine, is a straight down the
line ‘wrong’un’, constructed out of the assembly kit of feminist approved bad
male components. No redeeming features.From first to last he is bad egg.And Miriam, she of the continually tortured mien, Antoine’s ex- is a
good egg. So the script is a mono track development.From the moment we see Antoine in tag with
his brief at the custody tribunal, Legrande presents him as an image of a man
who cannot be trusted.The way his
faciality of expression is edited into the sequence and the way he dresses,
Antoine might as well have a placard hung about his neck: I am a manipulative
bastard.Au contraire, Miriam with her
carefully lens sculpted haggard look, might as well have a placard hung about
her neck reading: victim. </p>

<p>So the movie has only one place to go: the big shitty male
become more shitty and the victim and her kids become more victim.Of course as the whole thing winds itself up
in an apoplexy of abuse, the project runs out of road.It has to abandon its quasi legalistic
carapace take because it doesn’t provide enough bang for the buck.So Custody segues into Grande Guignole
operatic genre with Antoine adopting the role of the great mad man avenger
hunting his imagined victims with his rifle. </p>

<p>By the time Custody shifts genre, it has simply become
parody.The audience reduced cannon
fodder to be manipulated by a script that is a puppet show where the director
keeps hold of all the strings.Similar
to but different from the BMW advert that preceded it.</p>
