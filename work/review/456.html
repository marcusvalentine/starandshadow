Spacey.</p>
<p>Viewed Empire Cinema Newcastle 4 July 2017; ticket: £4.00</p>

<p>Mirror mirror on the wall who’s the fairest one of all…?</p>

<p>There is a certain type of film which in conception, script
and scenario is made as a act of narcissistic homage to its audience.I think that Edgar Wright's Baby Driver
conforms to this type.The culture of
‘image’ demands outer representation of self. Life is now lived out as acts of
personal projection as witnessed in: TV reality and quiz shows, music vids and
the anger and sadness individuals (in the West at least) manifest in the 24/7
news shows in interviews as victim. Unless a situation is ‘imaged’ we don’t get
it. Life has become the continuous performance of an acted out personal theatre. </p>

<p>Unfortunately this isn’t a personal everyday theatre of the
absurd.It is theatre of banality that uses
an outer conformed image to impress meaning into the everyday.Anger sadness and losshave to be accompanied by the appropriate exaggerated
gestures mimicking the expressive range of stereotypes seen on film and TV.Enjoyment too; laughter and having fun have
to be staged to produce for others the
confirming image of what is happening.But in terms of today, most of all the prized image is the ‘cool’
projection, an enigmatic admix of presentation style control and detached
involvement and knowingness.How cool
the show.The way we run, walk, interact
with others all have to display something for the other to see as ‘cool’. </p>

<p>And Baby is cool.He
embodies in all his actions ‘the cool one’. All that Baby does embodies in enactment his
cool image, endorsing for the audience the primacy of an acted out being in the world.</p>

<p>Live by image die by image.</p>

<p>As spectacle Baby
Driver is a retread of video games like grand auto theft (but with much much
better graphics) transposed as movie: got the chase got the music.The playing out of the automobile fetish as
an extension of the adolescent male control fantasy, the psychic interlude
between mom and destiny. </p>

<p>In some ways the spectacular in Baby Driver is not so much about
Baby’s driving prowess or the rendering of his multiple manoeuvres involving
impossible stunts close calls and near misses. Rather it is about the detached nature of
Baby’s driving in which it as if he is not so much driving as writing poetry with
the automobile.Perhaps not poetry but
something close to poetry like mathematical equations,using his vehicle to create and sketch out a geometry
crazy vectors.Baby is an artist using
pure line.How cool is that!Wright’s
action sequences have abstraction at their core.The parabolas and dazzling lines of Euclidean
geometry are demonstrated by Baby as on road theorems. These sequences are more cerebral than visceral.An
ultimate statement of ‘the cool’.</p>

<p>Wright’s replication of the game ethos precludes the
creation of tension as to how the action will be experienced.<span> Tension is not cool. Both </span>Electronic Games and Baby Driver are deintensified
productions because in a game if you
crash you start again: there is a built in inconsequentiality.The object of playing is mastery of the game.A mastery best served by detachment. Wright in his movie engenders this same
feel.As we view on the screen
Baby’s play out of dazzling mechanics and scintillating patterns of the vectors
and force lines, the problem posed for the movie is that of repetition.How do you top out each action sequence.Once patterns replicate and repeat, the wow
factor pay off from each stunt for each new equation, declines rapidly, becoming
a long flat tail of repetition.Of
course most SFX action movies are tested out by this problem.Without a script idea, they fail.</p>

<p>Wright has set Baby Driver at the end of the cassette tape
and beginning of the iPod era. The paradigm shift from analogue to digital. The
analogue age was a time when there were still objects at which you could
point.Such as money.It may now be impossible to set a bank heist
centred script in the digital realm of today.Banks don’t have money, shops don’t have money, theft’s now virtual and
viral.</p>

<p>The period setting aside, Baby Driver is interesting for
what it says as a reflection of salient aspects of this digital age.Those stylised elements and features that
characterise the new century’s modes and settings.One aspect that stands out in Baby Driver is
the expression of deterritorialised individuality.Baby
is an orphan.He is scripted as having
a guardian whom he now in turn looks after.But Baby is essentially alone and he has had to carve out his own
identity from the opportunities presented to him by culture and society.In this sense he resembles a super hero, or
perhaps a new generation of AI super computers.He is like a product of extra social forces.His identity is not drawn from community or
family or from a traditional repository of collective skills.Like a super hero or a computer, he simply
materialises.Baby is suddenly there on
the streets of the city with a set offully
developed talents with which to prove himself.It’s a statement of very contemporary fantasy. </p>

<p>Once the dream was to
win the pools or to pull off the robbery of the century.</p>
<p>The fall of chance or opportunity releasing you from the
drudge of work.The fantasy now is to
never have to experience work: no delayed gratification.Rather the dream now is that your own innate individuality
is sufficient to itself in the world.All that is needed is for your individuality to be discovered by a TV
reality show or on on line platform such a YouTube.To take or make the chance to show yourtalent to explode into the public
consciousness and enter the door of life.Your individuality is your talent. The mirror, or the mirror like movie that is
Baby Driver, reflects the image of you as an individual at the centre of the
universe;just need your moment of
opportunity and we can all be like ‘Baby’.</p>
