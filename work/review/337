<p>Ending up in the swamp</p>

<p>The writers who have chronicled the
dirty corrupt core of schizo USA, Robert Thompson, James Cain,
Raymond Chandler, James Elroy have all usually written from the first
person perspective.  What they knew was that this perspective enabled
them to express the state of mind of their protagonists.  And the key
to their writing is how events unfold within this state of mind. 
Writing from the first person allows expressive penetration in
understanding the situations and events that comprise a story.  The
committed narrator gives the story a psychic framework through which
actions and purposes can be grounded in a social and cultural but
individuated matrix.  When the first person device works, the
reader/viewer is drawn into a particular subjective world governed by
particular psychological rules.</p>

<p>Lee Daniel's (LD) The Paperboy (PB)
which he co-wrote with the author (Peter Dexter) of the novel, does
not use a first person narrative. The device used to set up and tell
PB's story,  is a retrospective interview, the recalled memory of the
black housemaid to the family at the time of the events.  Aside from
fitting up the film; which is set in the 60's, with its retro
political correctness, the device is purely mechanical.  It's a
non-perspective in the critical sense of mediating understanding. 
The maid's telling works as an aide-narrative to trigger and prompt
the situations that engage the doings of the main characters: 
Charlotte Jack, Ward and Hilary.   This interview device fails to
deepen engagement with the material; it does not open the movie out
into the possibility of entering into an immanent world.  The only
world engendered is a world of backgrounds, a world as a series of
possible suggestions against which the action is construed.</p>

<p>And yet PB like the works of the
American noir writers is set in an unbounded world.  PB is set in a
particular place, Florida, at a particular time, the 1960's, and
proposes a particular set of situations: an investigation of the
possible wrongful incarceration of a man for murder and the effect on
this situation of his would be gaol-bird bride.  These situations are
mediated through human agencies (newspapers, law enforcement
agencies,social agencies) which link the characters fatefully to the
wider world.  Unlike for instance the works of Tennessee Williams
which are tightly bound into the psychic realities of the settings
and the characters, and in which all development takes place within
these boundaries.   American noir style works to construct an
individual take on the complex of relations with social agencies, so
that they are absorbed by the reader/viewer as a subjectivity.</p>

<p>Without a first person to suggest a
world and to open up the story and to place it in a particular
psychic state,  LD is left with manipulations of other variables in
attempting to establish the authenticity of his material.  Failure to
establish some claim on authenticity in PB's story, condemns its
actors, whatever qualities they bring to the scenario, to the role of
puppets, cardboard cut out figures of the type that regale us in the
adverts before the movie.  All show no depth. 
</p>

<p>On viewing PB it seems as if  LD has
targeted the settings the locations and the sound track as affective
attributes to gain some traction on the attention of the viewers; 
attributes that are fashioned to lay some claim to signifying a
reality, an authenticity against which the actors can strut their
stuff.  
</p>

<p>But the backgrounds in PB have been
fabricated for their authenticity as period settings in themselves;
not for their effect in suggesting or creating a world.   In PB, LD's
settings do not comprise psychic containers for his material.  The
locations or situations all look right, but they are no more than
wallpaper, they bring nothing of substance to the film; they lack
qualities in themselves that might bring a sense of foreboding or
prescience to the film and envelope its narrative. The film ends in
the swamps (perhaps figuritively in the swamp of filmmaking), but
there is nothing in the film that leads us to this world of the
swamp.  It seems more like a tourist destination where we can go to
experience an otherness of environment and weird people.  The swamp
is swamped out by the desultory narrative that leads us there for
want of anywhere else to go, not through some psychic imperative of
drowning or sinking or being sucked in.   The purpose of the swamp in
PB is shown in the final shot of the film. The swamp is not a state
of mind that pulls you down drowns you in its fetid reptilian waters,
it is just a place from which to escape.  This last shot sees Jack
leave the swamp on the boat carrying out the murdered bodies of
Charlotte and Ward. The camera pans from the narrow channel of the
swamp water to the blueness of the ocean and its vast and boundless
possibilities. And the voice over, which by this time has lost any
credibility, informs us that, just like in the old fairy tales, it
all works out ok for Jack:  he ends up becoming a famous writer. 
Another lay of old Hollywood. 
</p>

<p>It's the familiar formula: trick out
the film in a period (50's 60's 70's – take your pick!) pay great
attention to getting the 'look' right and then allow the script to
play on the anachronistic gap between the period setting ( in this
case '60's Florida) and today's sensibilities.  Finally fill out the
sound track with lesser known unfamiliar but groovy records from the
period.  The purpose of the music is to fill out the psychological
dimension absent from the scenario;  and it is often more interesting
than the image.  (It used to require a certain specialist knowledge
to track down these records but the use of the internet now makes it
very easy: hence a number of films exploit this method of 'filling
out' their material – Seven Psychopaths { another woeful Brit
movie} also used this ploy)  But the music in itself, in PB. is not
employed with sufficient nous to add anything authentic to the film. 
It's just a juke box in the pub stacked up with some old records. 
LD's use of his tracks in PB, except for the bar scene, feels as if
the music has been dumped on the soundtrack at opportunist moments
with the aim of jigging up the audience's attention a little.  It is
not planned or scored into PB's sound track  as part of the film ( or
if it was in the scenario this might show how little the scenarist
knows about film).   Tarentino, Weir among others have understood how
to use prerecorded records to affect. Otherwise it's just background
music. No affect. Just a trick.</p>

<p>Lacking entry into a world mediated by
a state of mind, the actors are forced to jump through LD's
ridiculous hoops to try and convince the audience of the credibility
of their actions. The worse afflicted is Nicole Kidman (NK).  A
particular instance is the first visit to the prison by the 'group'
in order to see Hilary.  As the Charlotte character is no more than a
series of gestural demands from both script and director, the visit
is reduced to extracting just another gestural action from her; in
this case the crude and unconvincing acting out of masturbation
gesture at the demand of Hilary.  Because there is no access to
psychic reality both Cussack and NK are forced into a caricature of
forbidden discomforting (perhaps) sexual desire. (This type of
physical gesturing of fucking is repeated to equally uninteresting
effect when we do see them at work later, when Hilary is released,
engaging in penetrative sex).  For all her gesturing, eyeballing and
accent KB is little more than a coat hanger onto which to drape a
number of costume changes and listen to a number of old records.</p>
