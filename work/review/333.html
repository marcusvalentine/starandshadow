<p>Django Unchained   Quentin Tarantino
(USA 2012)  Jamie Foxx; Leonardo DiCapprio; Christopher Waltz</p>
<p>Viewed: Empire Cinema Newcastle upon
Tyne  Ticket £3.60</p>

<p>Digestive problems</p>

<p>Viewed on the budget ticket night
(Tuesdays) the cinema was full of people eating buckets of popcorn
and trays of Nachos.   
</p>

<p>Set in 1858 in Texas and the Southern
States of the USA, the only surprise in Tarantino's (QT) latest
confection of stylised violence, Django Unchained (DU) is that no one
uses a mobile phone. They would certainly come in  handy from time to
time in the old West and raise a laugh that would cut above the corn.
 These days it's almost cruel to deny the cowboy a touch screen, when
every other anachronism is OK. 
</p>

<p>DU is a movie that exemplifies the
notion that film has little left to express beyond revisiting its own
past and history and engaging in replication and recreation of itself
out of its previous forms.  Otherwise there is not much to say about
DU or QT.  Excepting that its bloated length and etiolated stretched
out structure is not sufficiently justified by QT's ambition of
revisiting almost every style of Western from John Ford and Hoppalong
Cassady through to Lars Von Trier, Arthur Penn and John Sturges. 
It's a belly full o beans as Mel Brooks might have put it, who is
paid extensive tribute in the faux KKK scene which is another
anachronistic farrago (laboriously and mechanically executed).</p>

<p>DU's narrative is simply a device to
enable QT to work through a sizeable number of action and sound
images that reference the Western genre in all its poly-variant
glory, whilst simultaneously exposing them to the distancing
mechanism of  dialogue and attitudinal gloss embedded in contemporary
discourse.  In relation to the referencing  two areas of the film
stood out: the film score in itself, and the landscapes and
backgrounds.  
</p>

<p>DU's score is a key to the way in which
the film psychically unfolds and affects.  The score quotes and
reprises every type of Western theme music of which I aware, from the
50's to date.  This music, much of it familiar  even if not actually
recognised, lends a disjunctive deconstructive element to the film,
working to detach and  disassociate the viewer from the relentlessly
aggressive modernist stream of the acting and dialogue.  The score,
in itself,  creates a meta track outside of the spacial
contemporaneity of DU, a space that comprises the dimension of
history.</p>

<p>The score brings history and the
traditions of the Western genre into the audience's consciousness.
The music allows DU to flow out from its performance bound present
back into a referenced past   The score adds the dimension of  time
to the experience.  Time is located on one of the film's tracks as a
counterweight to the  images and dialogue in DU that are
uncompromisingly dedicated as a celebration of the present.  The
music in the score, at given points in the development of the
narrative, swells and announces its momentary sovereignty in
affective mood establishment.  We hear in the music, the knightly
decoriously attired apple pie cowboys of 50's TV series, Cisco Kid
Roy Rogers the Lone Ranger.  These card board characters with their
noble steeds such as Silver, and their side kicks such as Tonto, are
briefly suggested, resurrected and brought back to momentary life as
phantom presences.  In the music, the epic Westerns of Ford and Wayne
swell up in our minds. Films such as: the Searchers Red River True
Grit, with their strange lone cowboy ballads, enter envelope and then
quit remembrance, shadows flickering on the cave wall of the mind. 
As DU ploughs through later Rock n Roll thematic cowboy anthems
suggested by the movies of Sturges, Peckinpah and even Von Trier (I
count  Mandalay as a Western) so too moments from these films are
reinvested in the score.  
</p>
<p>Softening the edges of an
uncompromising contemporary bad ass script, the score, in mediating
other filmic eras of fantasy and style, folds into the action, the 
dimension of an immersed recollection in other images, that makes it
possible to watch the film through.  
</p>

<p>Many of the action images in DU of
course pay homage to and quote all these types of films (some of the
images of horses were pure revisiting of the horses in the 50's US
cowboy series) 
</p>
<p>But it is the music in the score that
carries the history and which connects us to a cultural collective
memory.</p>

<p>In a similar vein the backdrops and
landscapes against which QT shot DU, serve a similar function to the
film's score. Their purpose again seems to be to act as an historical
reprise, to trigger nostalgia for earlier simpler forms of the genre.
 QT moves DU  through the whole lexicon of Western locations.  The
obviously fake studio recreations of 'rock outcrops' and 'camp sites'
through to the delirious encompassing landscapes of Ford and other
outdoor directors: the grand magnificent vistas that promise to open
up the whole world for us.  The movement between these exterior
locations and the 'back lot' studio look of the small Western towns
in DU, gives the film a dynamic range of image quotes from a wide
range of earlier Westerns, which in themselves, as the film develops
into an obvious pastiche, lends DU a sort of mantel of cod
authenticity.</p>

<p>Although the narrative revolves round
the raw issue of slavery and its horror, the acting out of the
sequences, the mannered detached stylisation of the actors ( who
perform in the manner of actors in adverts), never permits QT to
develop the film as anything more than a stylised exercise in violent
sequences.  Any more than James Bond could make any informed
statement about the politics of  democracy, no more can DU be
considered an angry diatribe against the evils of slavery.  These
films are about style and detachment from the real and the actual.  
As such, DU is a film that speaks to an audience that consumes
violence in the same way that they consume pop corn and nachos:
mechanically with little discrimination and in huge amounts.  There
there is a whole dimension of street violence that is concerned with
how it looks, personal style rather than what it means. 
</p>

<p>  DU as stated earlier may be a bloated
overlong production, but as a movie, pregnant with its own past, it
is QT's best filmic statement for some time.
