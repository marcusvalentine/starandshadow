<p>Citizen Jane – the Battle for the CityMatt Tyrnauer (USA2017)</p>
<p>Viewed: ICA Cinema London15 May 2017.</p>

<p>and what about today!</p>

<p>It is interesting to compare Matt Tyrenauer’s ‘Citizen Jane’
with Raoul Peck’s‘I am not your negro’.Peck’s movie had the singular virtue of
being written by its subject James Baldwin.James Baldwin’s words still have a pointedrelevance to race relations in the USA
today.Peck uses the urgency of
Baldwin’s text to fashion a film documenting the situation of Black people, using
images drawn both from the past and the present day, to show that little has
changed.Peck’s film takes up Baldwin’s
analysis and shows its contemporary relevance for an America psyche still
marked by an imbued sense of white racial superiority.This is today; welcome to the USA, says
Peck. Says Baldwin.</p>

<p>Like Peck’s film, Tyrnauer’s ‘Citizen Jane’ (CJ) has at its
centre of gravity a voice that rings out as clear perceptive true and
uncompromising. The voice of Jane Jacobs. </p>
<p>The difference between the films lies in their truth
content.‘I am not your negro’ has as its truth content Peck’s proposition
that Baldwin is relevant now because the fight against white supremacy
continues.Baldwin is, in this respect,
but one powerful fighter in a long line of warriors taking up the struggle for
Black respect.The truth content is the
continuity of the fight.</p>

<p>By way of contrast, Tyrnauer’s truth content centres not so
much about a proposition, but rather about the person of Jane Jacobs, locating her
and her battle exclusively in the 1960’s and 1970’s.‘Citizen Jane’ is locked in a time bubble. </p>

<p>CJ is pitched as a battle between Jane and Robert Moses who
was planning supremo of New York City for some 40 years.Moses was an insensitive arrogant power
broker who out manoeuvred and crushed opposition to his gargantuan urban
planning schemes.Moses’ planned
improvements were often, but not always, justified in terms of facilitating greater
ease of road transport.They ended up
smashing the very fabric of the city.They threatened to destroy the city as a place for life itself, its
naturalcapacity to mediate complex and
rewarding human interaction.Often
Moses’policies also had the effect,
never stated but which may have been intended, of decanting the poor out of high value locations,
in particular Manhattan, making it a better safer place for the rich.For poor, read ‘Black’ or ‘Hispanic’.</p>

<p>‘Citizen Jane’ works as a movie because Jane Jacobs and her
writing stand in the centre of the film. Jacobs was extraordinary because she saw what
Moses and the plannerswere doing to New
York.At a time when most people were
blind to what was happening, she saw what was going on and used her
extraordinary clear mind to write and
explain what Moses and the NYC planners were up to, and just how much damage
they were doing to city life. Jacobs saw
that Moses was not a god but a deeply flawed man corrupted by hubris who had
lost touch with reality.Moses had
become a destructive force.Jacobs was
able to take him on because of her ability to articulate a clear alternative
vision of the city, that was simple powerful and persuasive.She was also a formidable streetwise
political organiser.</p>



<p>Jane Jacobs won her battles with Robert Moses.But Citizen Jane’s truth content is no more
than re-telling of the David and Goliath fairy tale.The little woman takes on the ogre and knocks
him down.A good story.The kind of story the Disney Corporation
likes to tell.</p>

<p>‘Citizen Jane’
presents as a film with a knock out thesis.Wham bang, Goliath felled, we can all go home and lie safe in our beds. </p>

<p>Tyrnauer extends his material horizontally across space as
geography, showing contemporary images and film of other cities.These clips are usually interspersed with
academics and some contemporaries of Jacobs talking about what has been learnt
from her insights and analysis. The problem is that this film material is
diffuse vague and unfocused. It is difficult to make sense of the footage of
the various cities we see, because cities are particular places and we are not
given any information to understand them. </p>

<p>We are given a considerable amount on information about New
York.But Tyrnauer even as an epilogue
does not let the film develop through time, to give us some idea of how we
might connect Jane Jacobs thinking in the 60’s to whatis happening now on her old battleground.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Peck looks at what Baldwin’s words say today about Blacks in
the USA.Tyrnauer‘s film suggests that
somehow the struggle for New Yorks physical and social fabric was won by Jane
Jacobs in the 1960’s.He does not see
that in relation to the forces that Jane Jacobs took on, battles come and go,
battles are won and lost.But the war
goes on.</p>

<p>Moses was an exceptional figure, even so he was ultimately just the representative
of the vested economic interests that have always shaped the use of land of the
USA. The same forces that created the suburbs, gated communities,inner city ghettos, industrial parks now vision
the city as a high tech service economy, characterised by high rents and
leisure driven life styles.Mobility and
de-politicisation characterise the new vision which has slowly come into full
focus over half a century of development.Robert Moses has come and gone, but he is replaced today by a plurality
of hypercharged real estate developers, who are perusing very similar goals to
Moses.They are not driven by civic
ideological righteousness, but rather driven by greed for the huge returns and
profits they make on blue chip residential projects.The consequences are the same: a city for the
rich, the poor banished to the margins bereft of community and politically
contained. the creation of aprototype Eloi culture based on leisure.The
death of the life of the city.</p>

<p>Jane Jacobs’ struggles were only a episode of the war
between people who live in cities- like
new York – and those who would destroy them.This is the Tyrnauer’slimitation. The forces in play in
issues of land use are historical forces for which individuals sometimes hold
the banners and wield the sword.But
they are players, they don’t control script development.Today as more and more of New York ( and
other cities) is ripped down and apart to provide high rise apartments for the
rich, where are the Jane Jacobs? .Where are the people prepared to take on the developers and their
political sponsors who now stay well in the shadows aiding and abetting the
dirty work of destruction. </p>

<p>I think Jane Jacobs would have been disappointed in
Tyrnauer’s film. It is locked into a Disneyesque re-iteration of the past. She
won her battles but she would have known that this war continues.Tyrnauer fails to understand this.</p>
