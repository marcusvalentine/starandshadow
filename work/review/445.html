<p>The SalesmanAsghar
Fahadi (Iran 2016)Shahab Hosseini,
Taraneh Alidoosti</p>
<p>viewed Angelika Film Center NYC, 13 Feb 2017; ticket: $11.00</p>What's for sale?
<p>After filming ‘The Past’ in France in 2013, Fahadi returns to Iran in 2016, to make ‘The
Salesman’.Fahadi’s concern as film
maker to judge from the three films of his thatI have seen is locked onto human relations their functioning and the way
in which they break down, within the social and cultural context.</p>

<p>‘The Past’ was ineffective as an expression of the human
comedy, perhaps because Fahadi, marooned in France outside his native milieu, produced
a movie in which melodrama and plot driven concerns dominated the scenario,
whereas ‘A Separation’, his previous film, was about process.Those processes, emotional legal social that
mediated at the intersections between the personal and the public domains.</p>
<p>In ‘A Separation’ plot resolution was subordinate to
situation development. </p>

<p>In ‘The Salesman’ returning to a home Iranian setting,
Fahadi again focuses on relations not plot.Fahadi incorporates into his focus on the marriage situation of Emad and
Rana, the dynamics of the amorphous shifting cultural and social forces that
shape and form their relationship.Dynamics that ultimately suggest meanings for us the audience, but
meanings that are implicit in the behaviour and demeanour of the characters;
rather than explicitly stated melodramatic acting out. </p>

<p>Fahadi bookends and intercuts ‘The Salesman’ with sections
from Arthur Miller’s play, ‘The Death of a Salesman’.Emad and Rana play the lead roles of Willie
and Linda Loman in this small theatre group production.The manner in which Fahadi uses his chosen
excerpts from this particular play seems problematic at the level of meanings in the dialogue, but
is strongly suggestivein a more structural formal sense.</p>

<p>Fahadi opens “The Salesman’ with shots of the 'Death of a Saleman's' stage
setting; periodically throughout the
film he cuts to short clips of the play both in rehearsal and performance.But there is never enough information from
the text in these excerpts for an audience to have any notion of what the
play is about.You have only the play’s
title as a hook telling you that the play somehow concerns ‘death’.For the rest Fahadi simply presents us with observable formal
processes of this American drama:Emad and Rana are in a play where they pretend
to be/act out the roles of main characters; they dress up in clothes that are
disconnected from their way of life; they put on make up to disguise and
present themselves as other, in Rana’s case, as Linda, appreciably older; they
take on roles and speak lines of dialogue that are exterior to their culture.Yet in spite of this otherness, they somehow
remain true to themselves.In contrast
as the script develops the particular situation that presses upon their
marriage, they become less true to themselves.They become trapped in and by events, estranged from each other,
incapable of communication and honesty.This strange concept of Western drama exploiting the possibility of
individuated personal malleability (role playing) to illuminate otherness, alien
to mainstream traditional Iran, reflects a parody of truth of which the main
players, constrained by inhibition, are incapable.And it is Rana herself, not playing Linda, who
ages and wilts before our eyes, old and wise before her time, crushed by forces
outside her control. </p>
<p>The assault on Rana in her own home, shapes the development
of ‘The Salesman’.It is the event in
the movie that triggers the impulse that drives Fahadi’s script to range over
elements of the social and cultural matrix that have fateful implication for
both individuals and Iranian society. </p>
<p></p>
<p>At the heart of the film lie the relations between the sexes.The weight of law attitude and tradition
render women, in certain situations, almost powerless to oppose the male will to control.In particular in relation to those
types of circumstances that concern any type of female sexuality exposed to the public gaze or
knowledge. At the point of this exposure there is no
personal there is only public and the woman in her interiority and her exteriority
is identified only in terms of the male imperative.Rana’s mistake has consequences for her, both
in the social domain, where she has to endure the mute censor of her
neighbours, but most crushingly in her personal relationship with her husband.</p>

<p>It is not absolutely clear from the scenario, if Emad
accepts unconditionally his wife’s account of the event.What is clear is that Emad becomes less
concerned about Rana’s feelings than his own.The critical point for Emad is the cultural meaning of what has happened.What has happened is that this violation of
his wife has impugned his honour.There
is an inversion of victim primacy: Emad sees himself and becomes the main victim.And he is unable to give replete and deep
acceptance of the damage done to Rama, because his honour, even if it is a fake
display dishonestly assumed in bad faith, castes a shadow over the
relationship.</p>

<p>The relationship is now about display as Emad defaults to
the cultural prescription to restore his honour.Not hers.He becomes ‘the salesman’ determined to sell to her the outward signs of
his vindication.Of course Rana does not
want this, she desires the opposite, an intimate private acceptance.Instead of this she has to buy, in silence,
the commodity of honour which is all the salesman has on his tray.She also has to know that she and her husband can
never again engage in the charade that they are equals.</p>
<p>He is the salesman, and she has to buy whatever he sells.</p>

<p>Psychically crushed by the developments in this situation,
Rana retreats into a sort of cataleptic state.Muteness: the traditional sanctuary of those who have been emotionally
wounded. Obversely there is an irony
that in her theatrical role Rana, as Linda, can speak. In the play Rana and
Emad are equals.They both speak.In filmic role Rana cannot speak.Emad cannot speak.What lies before them is silence.</p>

<p>Silence seems to be an active force in Iranian society as
Fahadi, in scripted tangential moments, references elements that make up the everyday
experience in a city like Tehran.The
ruthless nature of real estate, the wide use of smart phones , fear of the
police, the omnipresence of censorship.Fahadi seems to say that you might think that the headlong rush into
modernity in a city like Tehran could undermine some of the foundations of
tradition; in fact it is more likely to deepen and harden brazen hypocrisy.</p>
