<p>Daughters of Darkness  (Les Levres
Rouges)   Harry Kumel (Fr 1971)  Delphine Seyrig</p>
<p>Viewed Star and Shadow Cinema Newcastle
upon Tyne, 3 March 2013;  Ticket: £5</p>
<p>retrocrit: Reading the runes in the
dunes or Marienbad transposed&hellip;</p>
<p>The seaside hotel by the sea on the
sands at Ostend, that is the location of Daughters of Darkness, is an
architectural statement that resonates along a parallel frequency to
that of  the chateau at Marienbad.  Harry Kumel (HK) in visualising
Daughters of Darkness (DD) must have had the notion that in having
successfully contracted Delphine Seyrig as his lead actress, DD could
take on in some of its formal aspects, the form of a subtle parody of
Last Year in Marienbad (LYM) 
</p>
<p>Geometry</p>
<p>The interiors of both LYM and DD both
allude to the taste spectrum and formal aspirations of  particular
social castes.  The Ostend hotel built for a burgeoning bourgeois
market seems to  consciously replicate the pretensions of an earlier
aristocracy. The resort hotel at Ostend is laid out as a palace, and
its opulent geometrical reception and public spaces will have been
planned as a sop to the aspirations of the European bourgeoisie and
lesser aristocracy that in a more public sphere they could by
imitation equal the taste of a foreclosed aristocratic age that
defined itself by private opulence and conspicuous consumption.
Whereas Marienbad was situate in grounds where nature was made
subservient to an ornamental geometry imposed by the hand of man; the
Hotel in Ostend is positioned by the sea.  Its geometric lines with
regular columns and serried windows seems built to oppose the force
of the sea, but is doomed to fail,  to be rendered insignificant by
the elements of darkening nature.   Within their settings, their
variegated encompassings both LYM and DD share a metaphysical core,
which revolves about ideas of time.  LYM with its infinite tracking
across surfaces and through mirror worlds, creates a metaphysic of
time that is presided over by the unnamed woman (Delphine Seyrig).
Time becomes a function of space, a function of a Nietzschian eternal
recurrence.  More crudely perhaps DD, with its vampire and human
blood theme also has an underlying temporal motif, the notion of
eternal life, life eternally relived and renewed through the medium
of human blood.  It may be thought that LYM is much subtler in its
insinuation of the time motif, but there is attaching to Resnais and
Robbe-Grillet's  mis-en-scene, something of the form of a religious
sacrificial ceremony.</p>
<p> Appropriate then that Delphine Seyrig
(DS) should play a key role in both movies. But whilst her role in
LYM is pivotal, in DD is central.   With her performance as the
Comptess de Bathony in DD, her persona dominates the film from the
moment she enters frame poised like a spider at the centre of her web
waiting to enmesh and devour her victims.   In her poise, DS 
effortlessly assumes the high status of her queen spider/ high
priestess and whilst on screen she spins our in her delivery of her
dialogue, a spell of enchantment, effortlessly without over
determination or crass exaggeration.     The delivery of her lines,
pulled from the silky depths of her throat, is perfectly synchronised
with her breath and the vowels shaped delectably by the reddest of
red lips.  The voice engages at once both with a knowing entrapment,
but also with an ironic distancing that allows us to see she is
having fun with her arachnoid role in a vampire movie. She knows how
to wear the frocks with an architectonic nuance as she has been here
before in another incarnation albeit with  a different haircut.  In
LYM the dresses were breathtaking, all white and feathery, DS  a
priestess cold with erotic indifferent to imprecation.  In DD,  HK
encases DS's body in a series of unceasingly stunning power frocks,
blacks and golds enabling DS to move through the scenario beguilingly
and effortlessly with increasing power as the personification of the
hunger for death.  In both DD and LYM, DS embodies the dark side of
the anima, the feminine bringer of death; both movies are built upon
her abilities to bring onto the screen this idea of a lethal anima.</p>

<p> In filming DD HK was assured and
confident in the understanding of how to use signs.  Signs are of
course what make horror movie genre work.  Contradictory signs
relating to roles, and the directional signs that point without
ambiguity to the path the script will follow in pursuance of its
narrative.  The signs that point are critical of course for arousing
anticipation, and anticipation either of pain or fear is what powers
states of arousal.  Many contemporary horror films, such as the Cabin
in the Woods often archly overplay signs, making them very blatant;
intended it would seem, not to  arouse but rather set up the viewer
for an ensuing voyeuristic gore/ slash fest; satiation of violence,
rather than fear, being the purpose.  So some 'horror'  movies made
today almost do away with the use of psychological signs preferring
to cut straight to the chase, the final blood sequence, either played
for laughs or whatever.  Movies of this era, such as DD, rely on
signs to prime the audience ( which is not to say that many of the
films are not tongue in cheek and capable of ironic self comment –
DD often is.)  But  the viewer is given work to do in interpretation
of signs and allowed to build their own anticipation of outcome. 
Movies shot using such formal scripted methods enlist more viewer
involvement and the occasional moments of  dread.   There is no
voyeurism rather it is anticipation of outcome that holds us, the
sign pointing the way.  The play on our minds. 
</p>
<p> Haircuts play a important part in the
filming of DD as of course they do in many movies – in particular
film noir.  But in DD, and horror genre they have a particular use as
signs.</p>
<p>The hair of the those representing the
forces of darkness, in this case Comptess Bathony, is usually rigidly
styled, like a wig (baldness can have a similar effect), DS's hair
permed in frozen locks that frame her face like a judge's periwig 
and suggest the idea of judgement,  judicial authority. DS under her
periwig becomes she who must be obeyed.  It also functions as a
counter sign to her voice which teases and bewitches, paralysing her
victims in the interplay of contradictory signage. 
</p>

<p> Victims hair for a woman is usually
long, often blond and hanging long.   In DD, Valerie's hair covers
her  face like a death shroud,  wrapping about her  face,
exaggerating and heightening the expressive affects of her  eyes and
mouth and throat. Like a lamb for the slaughter, the sign points as
soon as she appears.  DD is a woman's movie in the sense that the
only players are the women.  It is woman's business that comprises
its subject matter; it is about the dark force of the female anima, 
In movies of this kind the men really have no role and therefore
usually have nondescript haircuts.   In DD Mark's longish neatly cut
hair marks him our from the beginning as a non player.  Although he
has a role, he is a pawn, not central to the forces at work and
expendable.  
</p>
<p>As a horror movie DD is old school,  It
does exactly what it sets out to do. It sets up what is going to
happen allows the audience to anticipate it (understand the
inevitable) and for the signed events to come to pass, and then it
tells you they have happened. Managed through superb acting and
excellent pacing, the tension and humour are balanced, and deliver to
the audience a film that works as planned.</p>
