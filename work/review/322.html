<p><span>Berberian Sound StudioPeter Strickland (UK 2012)Toby Jones</span></p>
<p><span>Viewed Tyneside Cinema 2 Sept 2012; ticket
£7.00</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Sound perspective</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Peter Strickland (PS) in his previous film
Kataline Varga (KV) created a world invested with revenge in which the setting,
the sky and landscapes of rural Romania seemed to reflect, in our subjectivity,
the state of mind of the protagonist.Using the natural worldas a means of creating and suggesting mood, has an oracular
quality, combining the characteristics of being simultaneously both strongly
suggestive and ambiguous.KV
captured these qualities folding them into the play of the film without ever
fixing meaning.It is this evasive
and intangible interplay of mind and nature which endows KV with its filmic
movement and suppleness.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Something of the same formal concerns
define Berberian Sound Studio (BSS).The protagonist of BSS Gilderoy, unlike Kataline, is a passive rather
than active agent,ingested sucked
into an apparatus that is designed to create a parallel world of obscene and
contaminating ritual magic often expressing itself, as sound, in acts of
extreme violence perpetrated on the body.I was reminded of another apparatus:the death machine in Kafka’s in the Penal Colony.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>PS contrives the establishment of the
sequestrated world of the sound studio with superb conviction and
artistry.Set in the days of
analogue sound, the eponymousstudio is inhabited by a technical crew who have a shadowy otherworldly
quality.The crew Gilderoy joins
are working on the Sound Track of a Gothic Horror feature filmonto which the contrived sounds of hell
have to be dubbed.We never
see this film.It is veiled off
existing in another dimension, permitting us only to infer its nature from the
demands it makes (on its technical crew) which are the cues and evidence of its
nature.The only images we see
from the actual source movie are from its opening title sequence.This sequence comprising graphics which
deploy Medieval style woodcuts of witch hunts witch trials and the like, to
introduce a world where the body is the centre of the universe and truth has to
be marked in or on the body. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>The structure of BSS replicates this
Medaeval idea of truth in the sense that the sounds on the tracks, as they
assault and confront us, cut into us.The sounds have a physicality and through their physicality, a psychic
reality.Rather than just being
something we hear the sound has the force of incision, of a scarification. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>What we never see penetrates first body then psyche then
mind.The feeling from the opening
sections is of descent: watching Gilderoy’s relentless slide into unfathomable
darkness;watching a man sucked
down into quick sands.The studio
surrounded by long corridors have the quality not of an alienation but of a
nether/other world.The long
corridor leading to the studioat
the end of which sits the sphinx gatekeeper;the interior of the analogue sound studio with its spools
cogs and bobbins all have the quality of unremitting tireless mechanical parts
of the apparatus that serves some obscure function related to magic ritual
rather than film production.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>And so BSS reminds us of what we have
always known.There is a dark
magic in this art and craft of film making; this calling up of replicants and
entities,Is it simply that the
whole business has become so assimilated into our mechanical normalcy that we
have lost sight of this essential element in movie making.And the Foley area of BSS takes on the
ever more the suggestive potency of a sacraficial altar; and the lost souls,
the actresses called to scream as their vaginas are penetrated by red hot
pokers,calls to mind that films
has always demanded sacrifices and sacrificial victims, those who have been
unable to survive the devilish machinations of the industry. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>But of course in BSS everything is just as
it is: it is only a sound studio and any suggestion that Gilderoy is being
prepared for some sort of ritual event is only a suggestive play on our minds
through having seen too many movies and getting too involved in the rituals of
film making that we are watching.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>This establishment of the Sound Studio as
an apparatus,with Gilderoy (golden king - an arche reference to pagan harvest
sacrifice?)as critical to its
interconnective working suggests other apparatus in which we the audience are
also interconnective parts.The
strong associative sound worlds which surround and intrapenetrate our
lives.The world of sound in
itself detached from retinal images takes on highly concentrated and accelerated
intensity (noted by Marshall McCluhan)Following the news bulletins from the Iraq war, or the
reports of the destruction of the towers, we are plugged into a huge apparatus
projecting parellel worlds to which our defining relationship is primarily
fear. The excitement of our fears feeds the apparatus which in response
amplifies its output to incite further fear, until such time as the process
exhausts itself and self disappears without trace, leaving the connective parts
temporarily exhausted but primed for the next incitement amplification cycle.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>My feeling about BSS is that PShaving established the sound machine
filmic apparatus, becomes uncertain about what to do with it. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>What I liked in KV was the fact that PS
addressed the denouement only in terms of the forces and rules through which he
had set up his filmic proposition.BSS is set up as an objectivity. We see Gilderoy as a worker in a
situation, his work is beautifully counterposed by the letters from home
evoking his other world. But Gilderoy has no subjectivity; we are not given his
point of view or access to his state of mind.We watch him and that is what works because we have to put
the apparatus together.It is the
task of the viewer to understand what if anything is happening.But as BSS develops PS takes us from
outside to inside Gilderoy.BSS
becomes defined by what Gilderoy sees and experiences – dreams apparitions
hallucinations even the letter from home – and in this realising of an internal
state the original set up becomes banal.The film resorts to a Hollywood style literalism where the insecurities
of the film industry mean that audience have to experience andto see what has before remained hidden.
To actualise what has been only possibility.In the final sections of BSS, as PS fails to resolve his
film in and on its own terms his protagonist, Gilderoy, becomes the victim of
the director not of the apparatus.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>For the protagonist to be victim of the
writer or director is an interesting proposition if the conditions are
established for the crime. But in BSS it is simply a mechanical and less
interesting outcome.</span></p>
