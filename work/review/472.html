<p>downsizing the movie industry</p>

<p>Looking at the mid week audience of about 20 people
scattered throughout the sizeable 300 plus auditorium I was thinking that if
this was a representative mainstream movie, then the feature film exhibition
industry was itself about to be downsized.</p>

<p>Alexander Payne’s film opens with a promising proposition,
an allegorical proposition concerning the discovery of a scientific procedure to
miniaturise humans.The altruistic purpose behind the development
of downsizing by a Norwegian research group was to benefit the environment of
planet earth, that downsizing would mediate the catastrophic human effect on
the environment by enabling our footprint on earth to be reduced to a
sustainable smaller level.</p>

<p>Thus far so good.A
classic scifi proposition with a rich allegorical vein to explore.There are ideas that as starting points, could
set up any number of lines of development.But all Alexander Payne can do is drive his film into an allegorical and
conceptual dead end. His script suffers from the current Hollywood malaise of
not only being unfocused and unable spin a clear narrative; but also of seeming
to want to placate and keep onside the myriad phantoms of political correctness
that now flit through the inner psychic
calculations of American directors like swarms of censorious bats.</p>

<p>Downsizing is a
confusion.Payne’s script tries on all
sorts of allegorical clothing. Abandonment, as Audrey Paul’s wife ducks out
of downsizing without telling him, appears for a moment as a core theme.Downsizing trips out as: cryogenic style hard
sell where the big cynical corporations cash in on the desires of the gullible;
downsizing is pitched as a quasi religious conversion experience; as a noble
ecological experiment. It is also looked
at as an individually tailored solution to the suburban cash flow problem. When
downsized the cost of living is reduced so that the American dream (which is
basically doing nothing except sitting in the sun and consuming stuff) is
attainable by everyone.All you have to
do is trust the banks to handle your money wisely.</p>

<p>But each of these ideas, and their inherent contradictions, is picked up and put down like a tourist
bauble in a bazaar. Any one or
combination of these ideas carries the internalised satiric drive that could
energise the core of a script. Further,Payne
only skirts the dark side of downsizing: it’s potential use as a control
mechanism; downsizing as a punishment; the vulnerability of being as small of
being prey to the rapacity of birds vermin and insects. And of course thepotential for the vicious malice of the world
to intercede in the little world to make its power and presence itself felt.
The possibility of the normal sized people capturing the little people and
keeping them for entertainment and torture.</p>

<p>In the first sections of the movie the defining shots worked
to suggest the oppressive collective consensual uniformity of the suburban
culture in which Paul is located: tracking shots of the meat processing plant,
with its myriad ranks of sterilised butchers gutting and stripping flesh; the
series of shots detailing the mass downsizing chambers with theirattendant technicians; and Paul’s emergence
bereft of his wife, into the downsized world opens up a filmic vista reminiscent
of the Truman Show.</p>


<p>But at this pointPayne’s
movie starts to simply unravel, drifts off into forgetfulness. </p>

<p>Failing to fit out Downsizing with any sort of envelopment, Payne eventually opts for the hippy trip as
the solution to his scripting direction.About half way through the film Paul is invited to his neighbour’s party,
an event that is filmed to look like something Russ Meyer might have shot in
the 60’s or 70’s ( Beyond the Valley of the Dolls), a typical Hollywood rendition of the Hippy
Happy all night Party with drugs sex and soundtracked with anodyne generic feel
good american rock music. </p>

<p>The Russ Meyer party scene becomes defining moment in
Downsizing.From this point on,Payne loses all interest in his miniaturisation
concept.The proposition is just
dropped. The film instead transforms into a rather dull ‘quest’ movie. Downsizing simply fills out its duration with
characters and settings: Paul’s spunky Vietnamese girl friend, two Russ Meyer
escapees and an old hippy colony on Norwegian Fjord.Again the Hippy Cult with its echoes of
Manson, Jones and Koresh might have provided a rich vein of black satirical
probing.But Payne plays it sort of
straight.The Hippy colony disappears
down into a hole in the ground to find salvation, with Paul at the last moment changing
his mind and escaping back to his chums.</p>

<p>The ending has forgotten its beginning.No one cares.</p>

<p>Of course by leaving his ending open, with Paul and his
girlfriend free agents above ground, Payne leaves open the possibility of a
Downsizing 2, to drive even more people
out of the downsized cinema. </p>
