<p>Kick Ass</p>
<p>Ok folk I wrote about the real superhero story Defendor the other day and I have seen another new real people wearing pants over lycra film, the blockbuster Kick Ass by Matthew Vaughn.I really didn’t think you could beat Defendor and I guess in some ways you can’t, I mean they are very different with one being set more in reality than the other.I have to say thanks to Northern Lights for letting me come to his showing as I had a brilliant night.I am not really a cinema person as I don’t really like sharing my experience but this was one of the best nights out I have had at the cinema in years.</p>
<p>Kick Ass has a fantastic start, when our hero Dave Lizewski played by Aaron Johnson AKA kick ass dons a divers suit, really gets his ass kicked and I mean a proper ass kicking.I went to this movie expecting to see something fun and somewhat childish.It was fun, really fun, it had me laughing loudly throughout the flick but it certainly was not childish.The characters were well fleshed out and had a lot more depth compared to those of Defendor.Mark Miller who wrote the Graphic Novel really understands the world he is dealing with, referencing the superheroes of comics, film and TV on so many levels and I reckon it would take several viewings and a really in depth knowledge of the super hero world to acknowledge all the references.Dave Lizewski is definitely your normal Joe blogs, unlike the alter ego that is supposed to be normal looking but is actually on the handsome side, as in films like Spiderman or the hulk.As soon as he suits up though he definitely is a reference to Sam Raimi’s Spiderman but without the ability to climb walls, spin webs, make perfect costumes or even really hurt anyone.</p>
<p>Nicholas Cage has been in a good film at last since ‘Lord of war’ and he plays his character well.The villain Frank D’amico played by Mark Strong is very good.His role of balancing being an attentive father with that of just having anyone killed who doesn’t give him the answer he is looking for.It is also good to see a Superhero movie in which the show stealer isn’t the villain.The show stealer is Hit Girl played by ChloeMoretz, a 12 year old girl who is charming, direct, has a foul mouth, is skilled with the the Filipino and looks so cool in a purple wig.She is a little firecracker who reminds me of the Robin from the brilliant Frank Miller Graphic ‘Novel Dark Night Returns’.You can’t see enough of her in the film sliding under villains’ legs and shooting them in the head or sliding across tables and knifing them in the chest.If I had a daughter would be so proud, enjoying her repartee with the neighbours as she called them cunts.Sadly I would find it quite difficult only being able to see her once a fortnight at the maximum security detention centre.That brings me nicely to my final point.</p>
<p>The film recognises it stands outside the Marvel and DC Universe nodding its head directly to the characters from these worlds throughout the film while accepting they are fictional characters in a fictional reality.The truth is though these characters and this universe is just as fictional.At the beginning of the film Dave Lizewski is talking with one of his friends wondering why no one has ever thought of wearing a costume and fighting crime and it is from this conversation that he chooses the name Kick Ass.The reason why though is less we will get our ass kicked and more most of us don’t really know any crime bosses who live in penthouse suites or have friends at school who volunteer at really clean, specious needle exchange centres and have crack dealing ex-boyfriends with body guards outside their door.Most of the criminals we know are telling us we are going to war thousands of miles away and removing more and more of our job security or selling us high sugar foods or clothes with people’s names on them made in factories in the same countries we are going to war with.</p>
<p>Overall this was a brilliant movie.My only little gripe was the bullshit 1st person shooter reference which was just totally out of place and a waste of more opportunity to see Hit Girl in action.I will surely be watching this film again sometime and I recommend you do to.</p>
