<p><span>Blitzo
Schizo</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Petri
‘s ‘Property is no longer a theft’ (‘Property”) is a fable after the Aesop
fashion.A moral Brechtian tale wrapped
up in the delirium of filmic form.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>‘Property
is no longer a theft’ is a take on Proudhon’s famous assertion (property is
theft), and moves on Petri’s perception that property is not so much a theft
rather it has become a schizophrenic madness that rips up men and their social
relations. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Petri’s
movie is an inspired satire on the madness in money and capitalism.A film construed as a satanic black comedy,
an oppositin of good and evil;a relentless
parody on a society defined through inequalities ofownership and wealth, and rendered psychotic
by the intensity of desires they unleash. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Petri’s
script is Brechtian in its structure.The main characters defined by the situations Petri puts into play
rather than their personalities. Total, the money allergic bank clerk, the
Butcher the property owner, Anita the Butcher’s mistress.The roles are highly individuated but played
out by the actors as types.They are not
subjectivities. Their situations in relation
to property make them the sorts of people they are. As types each of the main characters is
granted by the script, one soliloquy; a
communication delivered directly to the audience, in which each reveals
candidly and repletely how they see the world and their place in it.These pieces as insights, dynamically connect
the characters with the viewer,; they are key elements in the films structure,
linking states of mind to the film’s action. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>The
script with its Brechtian design exploits symbolic devices to throw into relief
the cavernous dark spaces in which the scenario plays out.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>The
script whilst in the form of a transposed fable has a simple magico-religious
device at its core that allows a dark absurdity to play through the schizo
desires of the haves and have not’s. Total is a have-not, and knows he will
always so be.In a puff of smoke (literally)
Total quits his job in the bank, vowing to revenge himself on the rich Butcher
whose great piles of money he has had to count every day.But Total, who is allergic to money as it it
makes him itch, understands that money
is a form of death wish and sickness, so he invents what he calls mandrake
communism (hallucinogenic communism?) to
pay out the Butcher.Disdaining money, Total takes on the mantel of
the shaman, and in a series of slap-stick cameos resorts to stealing the
Butcher’s power objects: his butcher’s knife, his hat, his jewels and finally
his girlfriend the abused and fucked Anita. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Although
knocked off balance by the loss of his power objects, the butcher remains
powerfully protected by the shibboleths and mantras of wealth, consoling
himself that there is no point in having objects is no one wants to steal
them.And repossessing Anita on her
return to his flat, fucks her and celebrates his wealth with each thrust into
her groin, before climaxing andin
ejaculation gasping out that as wealthiest motherfucker in Rome, he is also the
most degraded and pitiable.A scene that
crafts out of a satyric farce, the schizo relationship of wealth possession and
sex.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Total’s attempt to destroy the butcher fails.The butchers madness simply integrates him
deeper into the grain of a deeply psychotic society where all the
contradictions of death madness and possession co-exist in instable
counterbalance.All that the thief can
do is to validate wealth.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>So
Total changes tack.He cunningly insinuates
himself into a robbery, after which the madness of money starts to corrupt him
and overtake him.As he has foreseen,
money marks him out for the forces ofdeath, and like all good protagonists the unlucky man ends up murdered
by his arch rival.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>W</span>hat
makes Petri’s film outstanding is his use of both camera and the sets</p>
<p>to turn his fable
into a total cinematographic experience.Total’s storyis form and content
folded into cinema, the seamless interplay of the power of movement images. </p>

<p>The camera movement is extraordinary.An interplay of vertiginous pans tilts arcs and
parabolas.The camera is dancing, a
dance that pulls together space both as an exteriority and an interiority. The cameraspins the webs, the networks of attraction
and repulsion that form the threads of Petri’s concerns. As a visual motif the camera's change of angle from an elevation and to the horizontal captures the
subject’s situation with  a movement of elegant simplicity</p>

<p>Today’s directors like to keep the camera moving.<span>  They </span>move the shot to supress the fear of their
audience getting restless. Today's camera movements and placements are usually
no more than distractions.<span>   But </span>Petri’s camera stitching together, in close up, of his subjects as relational objects in a balletic choreography, enables the audience to absorb without words the complexity of what is happening.   </p>

<p>Likewise the sets used in ‘Property’ add another dimension
to Petri’s movie. Setagainst the eye of
the flowing camera, the background sets are dark baroque and heavily
ornamented.They are spaces which absorb
people imprison them, a chiaroscuro of corruption created by relief and
shadow.The sort of worlds made by money
and into which money is absorbed.A
world that has an Italian resonance where the shadows of politics, dirty money
and religion are so deep no one can see what is really going on.A world of mystery. </p>

<p>Petri’s delirious cinema,  grounded in a script  guided by the tenets of a Brechtian morality, reads out in a clear strong voice, the
twisted schizophrenic canon of contemporary capitalist madness.</p>
