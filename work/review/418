<p>The Hateful EightQuentin
Tarantino (USA 2015)Samuel L Jackson</p>
<p>viewed: Tyneside Cinema Newcastle; 9 Jan 2016; ticket: £8.75</p>

<p>For all the boys in Raqaa</p>

<p>As I watched the pretitle sequence I thought this was probably going
to be a terrible movie. The pretitle sequence comprised a series of chocolate
box shots of snowy landscapes. (The film industry reviewers love these shots
and call them ‘breathtakingly beautiful’ etc; I am never won by this sort of
easily shot stuff)Tarantino’s opening
shot was a big wide snowscape; followed by another wide snow shot this time
with birdies, then some more snowy shots leading finally to a close shot of a
tree. All these pictures accompanied by formulaic baggy electronic chord
music.This series of shots said nothing to me, communicating
only a meandering unfocused directorial mind.OK, it’s only the beginning of the film.But perhaps beginnings are important: as in
the end so in the beginning.</p>

<p>This dull sequence finally resolves into the animated credit;
then we see see another close up.It’s
a shot ofa wood carved somewhat
tortured face of Christ. And I am thinking: woah!This looks like Lars von Trier
territory.Tracking back from this wood
carving of the crucified Christ we see the distant form of an approaching stagecoach
which goes up and past the camera.This
shot at least points to something: there are travellers abroad in this snowy
land</p>

<p>Lo! We have seen the emptiness filled out with an image of
religion and journey. </p>

<p>In retrospect (something Tarantino used to be good at) the
opening had at least a coherence lacking in the remaining three hours.</p>

<p>Tarantino has previously used Hollywood as a frame of
reference taking ownership of its images and clichés with his own scenarios
comprising of a violently perverse mixture of inversion satire homage and
spoof.The intensity of his filmic
imagination holding together a diversity of expressive devices.The problem with Hateful 8 is that it lacks
intensity.And intensity is the glue
that holds Tarantino together. Lacking intensity the Hateful 8 falls apart into
its constituent parts, revealing Tarantino as a director out of control of his
resources and unable to understand the forces he has set into play.</p>

<p>One of his main resources is of course his players.In the Hateful 8 the acting can be described
as a series of pantomime performances. This beanfest of camp theatricality might have
expressive possibility if the parts were scripted with a greater stylistic flexibility
and had the scenario and Tarantino’s direction been able to reconcile the stylised
form of the acting with an intensity and pace.Filmed without flair Tarantino’s stage is crowded out with wannabe Dames
and Villains, Dandini’s and Prince Charming’s.The Hateful 8 is mono dimensional
and the film becomes a bad three hour panto in which all the players seem to
tire of the flummery and mummery and wish it were all over.Even Samuel LJackson cupping choc–o-no-nuts, seems to give up on the force fed
scripted material which lacks substance credibility or tension.Samuel L Jacksons seems in the end a pitiful
waste of a huge screen presence.</p>

<p>The Hateful 8 comes complete with laboured running joke
about the outside door; a joke which doesn’t even have a pay off line.Couldn’t they think of one? On the evidence
of the script probably not.</p>

<p>Tarantino’s sauce of inspiration in the Hateful Eight is no
longer only Hollywood, but also Lars von Trier land.Hollywood myth is part of the setting of the
film: it is Christmas. Cue Capra.There
is a moment of classic Tarantino inverted Capra in the scene where a killing is
accompanied by the playing of Silent Night, but otherwise for the most part it
is as if Lars von Trier presides over this ‘otherland’like a demonic magi casting ideas and notions
into the forms of contemporary incubi and succubae.</p>

<p>Lars von Trier’s engages with cinema as an act of exorcism, calling
up and taking on his own and by extension our demons. </p>

<p>The problem is that Tarantino doesn’t seem to understand von
Trier at any level deeper than visual affect. As if in homage to Bergman, you
just stick a chess board on set and think that does it.The Hateful 8 seems to replicate von Trier’s
sadistic relationships with women.Although von Trier’s tough on-set relationships with his female leads is
well documented, his films’ messages often place the female lead at the centre
of complex social relations, using the vulnerability of the female to point up
the corruption in society. The hanging of Bjork’s Selma represents a sort of
uncompromising moral victory for her. Tarantino’s
hanging ofDaisy Domergue is simply another
desperate gratuitous step in winding up a bankrupt script with a series of
pointless excesses. </p>

<p>Tarantino’s excess is guided by the same compass as modern
warfare: the imperative is to get to the
end with everyone dead.Death is power. The
Hateful 8 is is driven by a script which will be enjoyed by the boys in Raqqa,
who will download the movie with rapture and joy that there is an American who
also shows the way.Well I guess Guantanamo
and Abu Graib are now part of the circuitry that in which movies and reality amplify one another. </p>

<p>Tarantino used to be a dab hand at script writing.The Hateful 8’s script is terrible. The words
Tarantino puts into his players mouths (I did think some may have been written
by Jackson who has made so many films with Tarantino that he must know what’s
expected) are leaden repetitive slow paced and lacking incision. The words
demand an arch delivery that calls up a faux theatricality of delivery. The dialogue in Von Trier’s Dogville had some
of the same qualities as that of the Hateful 8 but he demanded of his actors a
studied intensified delivery. Dogville
was underpinned by Trier’s vision of the social and moral bankruptcy of America
and its race relations.Von Trier’s
scripting was crafted so that these concerns gradually surfaced through the
movie, to finally take on a moral primacy.Tarantino’s script is crude, exploits the racial, black and white
tensions to try, unsuccessfully to energise the deadness of the material.</p>

<p>In structuring the Hateful 8, Tarantino is only a poor
imitation of what was a masterful element of his films.Where successful he edits his films as broken
temporal sequences that shift time back and forth in the time line of the movie
creating both inventive tension and dramatic surprise.The Hateful Eight breaks up the temporal
sequence in a heavy handed clumsy manner by showing us the start of the story
as the penultimate sequence.It adds
nothing to the film and the only tension it creates is in the dismay of the audience
who realise they are going to have to sit through another 20 minutes whilst Tarantino
tells us what we already know.</p>

<p>This is Tarantino’s ninth movie, I think. He says he is only
going to make 10 films. On the basis of this 9 is enough.He’s run out of road. </p>
