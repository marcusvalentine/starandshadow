</a><p>Wages of Fear  (le Salaire de la Peur)   Henri-George Clouzot  (Fr
1953)  Yves Montard; Charles Vanel; Vera Clouzot</p>
<p>Viewed Star and Shadow Cinema 8 Dec 2013; ticket price: £5</p>
<p>Requiem for white trash&hellip;requiem for us all&hellip;</p>
<p>Clouzot's Wages of Fear is a filmic probe into the colonial and 
neo-colonial relations between the West and the developing world in
the latter half of the twentieth century.  Although film  contains
superbly crafted action sequences, its power derives from two
defining elements. The scenario written  as  a series of beautiful
and powerful metaphors: insects, the dusty town, the trucks the lake
of oil the fire.   And secondly its action is never detached from its
driving theme: exploitation.   
</p>
<p> The opening setting is in some Central American country, an arid
clapboard sun bleached small town in the middle nowhere: but close to
oil.  The opening shot of the movie is a condensed visual symbol of
the film's theme, a movement image, a tracking shot that links the
initial close up to the wide perspective.  In close up a clutch of
insects, scorpions perhaps, murderously crawl over each other in a
hollow in the ground, scooped out of the dust.  As the camera pulls
back we see that each of these venomous creatures is attached by a
piece of string to a small wooden frame held in the hand of a small
boy.  The child has these creatures, which could kill him, by the
balls. Distracted by something happening in the street, he yanks up
the stick frame, leaving the creatures spinning helplessly in mid
air.   A perfect expression of what is going on in this place. 
Clouzot's camera, in this tracking shot as elsewhere in the film uses
the shot to pull together disparate images into one idea.</p>
<p>The function of the town is to supply the oil industry with cheap
labour.  Seen through the eyes of the white trash marooned in the
town, the first part of Clouzot's movie establishes the economic
realities of  a rentier economy.  The oil company controls
everything.  They hold all the strings.  They decide who works. The
men in the town supply the non unionised cheap labor to the company:
they either send remittances back or they come back as corpses.  The
white trash gaze on with indifference as a woman angered by the
return of nine shrouds, pours out a political tirade of scorn and
condemnation of the oil company.  Her anger attracts and raises a
crowd who temporarily overrun the company guards.   But they are a
demoralised people and lack the resources to sustain a prolonged
struggle.   
</p>
<p>If the town and its people are the fulcrum of exploitation, then
the poor whites represent an expendable but useful alternative
resource: a sort of social counter balance.  The whites also have
lives of little value, but their need to define themselves apart from
and as essentially different from the natives, gives them a certain
value to the company for certain types of dirty work. Today they are
mercenaries hired by companies such as Blackwater. In Wages of Fear,
they are the drivers of the death trucks.</p>
<p>Wages of Fear divides into two parts. The first part, realist in
representation, establishes the town as two groups of people with
separate relations, states of mind and attitudes vis a vis the Oil
Company. The second part, focusing on the whites, depicts their
journey of terror as they ferry nitroglycerine to the blown out oil
wells.   Much of this second part is shot so that it has an abstract
quality.   Even the final ordeal of driving the truck through through
the lake of black oil, has an abstracted metaphysical resonance.  
Like evil the black slime overwhelms Joe and Mario.  In the image of
the oil spill we see they ( and us) are drowning in forces of
corporate capitalism, which penetrates into the totality of being.   
</p>
<p>In this second half of the film,  the focus is on the abstracted
interior of the cab of the trucks.  As the landscapes ghost by in the
headlamps, it is in these compressed psychic spaces where the schizo
states of mind of the men play out.  Living with the possibility of
death at every jolt and hole in the road, goaded by the promise of a
huge cash payment, the scenes in the darkened cabs take place at the
intersection of the men's fear and desire; the forces that finally
kill them.  The forces exploited and controlled by oil.   
</p>
<p> But although the forces set to work by Clouzot have an abstract
quality, his actors, in particular Yves Montard as Mario, bring,with
their bodies, a raw physicality to their roles. They are flesh and
blood.  In contrast to Anglo Saxon world, France in the pre 60's
period presented an open minded attitude towards homosexuality (at
least in Parisian arts circles). Acceptance of homosexuality tended
towards its quasi glamorous representation, emphasising the  cerebral
rather than the physical. Clouzot breaks out from these artsie
boundaries. The mercenaries are rough trade.  Their gender doesn’t
define their sexuality.  Ingenuous acceptance of homoerotic
relations, is part of who the men are.  Clouzot places this
undifferentiated sexuality at the core of his characters.  The
physicality between  men pressed together in the tiny cabs, is
emphatically realised when Big Joe, the macho guy with the gun,
adopts the passive role of the woman.  Mario ends up treating Joe
with the same callous indifference with which he treated Linda&hellip;  
</p>
<p>Vera Clouzot the director's wife, plays the part of Linda.   With
her painfully thin waif like figure she represents a terrifying but
almost comic book figure of frailty.  In Wages of Fear the men have
scorned women,  and she is little more than an object of Mario's
abuse.  But she is also the foil for her husband's black Bunuelesque
anti religious humour, that runs through the script.    As Linda
prays fervently, like Viridiana, in a scene of mawkish religious
sentimentality, she looks up and sees the soles of the shoes of one
of the white trash who has hung himself suspended from the beam above
her.   
</p>
<p>In the penultimate scene Clouzot presents his final visual
metaphor.  The shots of the fires at the well head.  It is an
apocalyptic vision of hell: raging fire, black smoke.  A vision of
the where the big oil companies and the world of oil, are taking us. 
As if to say the Gods whom we serve are implacable and will destroy
us: if not today then tomorrow. Be warned.</p>
