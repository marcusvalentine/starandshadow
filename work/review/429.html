<p><span>Men and Chicken (Moend og
Hons)Anders Jensen (2015 Dk)David Dencik; Mads Mikkelsen</span></p>
<p><span>Viewed Tyneside Cinema 19
July 2016; ticket: £9:15</span></p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p><span>Anders Jensen’s Men and
Chicken gives the impression that as a director he may have been influenced by
watching too many Scandi-noir TV fillers. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Men and Chicken is a
Danish noir comedy and shows its Danish TV provenance in the way it is
structured by drawing on the lessons of these successful dark toned audience
pleasers such as the Bridge (to which Jensen sort of gives homage in one
peninsula island shot repeated several times).Its scenario is built around one key input idea which is embedded deeply
into the scripting ; the key characters are all deeply flawed and have
signature facial expressions,looks
which are directed both inwardly and outwards and which are inscrutably Nordic.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Whilst this structural
format may work OK with a weekly TV serial format, it is harder to make it work
for a one off feature film. This format of TV serial slowly builds up to the ‘big secret’
that lies at the cancerous heart ofits
scenario.To maintain interest and to
develop its characters, a TV scenario works through sub plots counter plots
parallel plots and side plots, engaging the audience in distractions,
ambiguities and red herrings all the while moving portentously towards its mega
exposure. On the small screen the facial tics of the actors, the monopacing, together
with the banality of the editing and shooting style can be carried through by a
scripting/editing style which uses
multiple parallel stories (in the various guises of sub plotting) to shift
energy and hold audience attention.These
TV pot broilers are designed /intended for broad durational parameters to take
up multiple TV scheduling slots.They
work mainly through stylistic intensity and the complexity of their narrative
strands. </span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span>Condensed into feature
film length rather than a 5/6hour TV sleep
over, Men and Chicken looks like a one trick pony, and at the end when the
trick is revealed, it’s not very convincing.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Jensen opens his film,
with some egg shots and with the voice of a girl who in fairy tale style tones
explains over picture that this is the story of brothers to whom nature hadn’t
dealt the best cards.Jensen seems to
be trying to cast the film as a fairy tale or perhaps archetype myth (Thanatos
the father figure is one of the Greek bringers of death; and Ork the name of
the island where the action happens</span><span class="st"><span> is a fictional humanoid
creature that is part of a fantasy race akin to goblin.)But nothing in the film works as myth or
fairy tale.And when the girls voice is
heard for the second time, it is at the end of the film, where her voice makes
a non mythic type of plea for acceptance of diversity.A plea with is in line with political correctness but not with fairy tale
or myth. </span></span></p>
<p><span class="st"></span></p>
<p><span class="st"><span>The
use of the young girl’s voice and her dissociation with anything seen in the
film points to Jensen’s insecurity with his material. He doesn’t know what film
he is making. Is is a comedy, a horror movie, a buddy movie sci-fi movie or
whatever? Jensen tries to cover all bases and ends with a production that is
simply tendentious and doesn’t feel like it is about anything.Hence perhaps the mawkish summary at the end,
a desperate attempt to salvage something in the sphere of contemporary ethics.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="st"></span></p>
<p><span class="st"><span>Unable
to focus clearly, Men and Chicken instead plumps out its script.The scenario is pumped up with obsessive
masturbation and vomiting, bestiality, mutantcy, cosmetic prosthetics for the
actors, the idea of a slightly deranged or simple class of island dwelling
people, a boys’ excursion to the nursery.None of this material is developed enough to sustain interest.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="st"></span></p>
<p><span class="st"><span>Along
other filmic dimensions Jensen’s film has few qualities. The shooting/editing
of the film is conventional shot/reverse shot, and adds nothing to style.And the acting, for all the prosthetic work
carried on the actors faces, never rises above the one dimensional.Perhaps had more thought been given to
mutations that could not be seen, either psychic or somatic&hellip;there might have
been a more interesting movie. But that movie would probably be better made with
the imagination of Lars von Trier.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="st"></span></p>
<p><span class="st"><span>Men
and Chicken ends up a dull movie.In another
life time, the idea with intricate multi-phased elaboration in a closed
community, might have made very good TV fodder.</span></span></p>
