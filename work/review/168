[Essay on Class War, Dream On, and ultra-left critique, published in Here &amp; Now, no. 14, pp.18-22, July 1993]<p>Despite readers' criticisms and editorial self-doubts, <i>Here and Now</i> is steering a fruitful
path between academicism and the risks of self-marginalisation and ritualistic
ultra-leftism. Assessing the power of middle class ideology (e.g.
managerialism, professionalism, bureaucracy) is long overdue, given that middle
class groups and agendas are instrumental in making quite fundamental decisions
in the running of capitalism and the disposition of State resources; control of
resources and personal ownership of capital no longer necessarily correspond;
and when the course of so much of our day to day experience follows directions
moulded by scientific and professional power. </p>
<p>A
close attention to the complexities of new middle class discourses and
practices, in terms of their effects in real life situations, could begin to
answer some of the desperation and plaintive demands of older generations of
radicals, such as ex-Solidarity member Andy Anderson,1 without
mistakenly expecting answers from specific theoretical currents. The role of
theory itself in radical politics (i.e. as employed by professional revolutionaries)
should also be questioned, given that one of the libertarian left's most
conspicuous failings must be its inability to talk about modern Western class
structures without falling foul of vulgar marxist fantasies of class struggle. </p>
<p>The
kind of pitifully inadequate formulation which has capitalism exploiting
either: industrial workers; or, everyone who is waged; lingers on even in more
dynamic recent movements such as Class War. Ironically, this may partly be a
result of giving a privileged position to theory itself - felt as a necessity,
having value prior to its use or any relation to practice. This parallels the
structure and effectivity of middle class discourses in general, which also
create realities (in the sense of shared frameworks for expression,
communication and action) with considerable potential and actual force in the
world, but which take little account of their effects - except those given high
status within the discourse. Perhaps the traditions of classical anarchism and
syndicalism, and of postwar left communism (e.g. councilism, situationism,
autonomism) can now function only by reproducing the tensions always inherent
in marxism - relating to the desire for a theory of total and conclusive causes
and explanations. When undermined, the arrogance of this desire is unveiled for
what it is, and so are its links with other imperialising middle class
discourses. Remember, it is only 'theoretical' ground that is lost, and in
terms of revolutionary politics this is a traumatic prospect mainly for those
who stand primarily on theoretical ground.2 </p>
<p>A
humility of theory, on the other hand, may allow more critical practices to
emerge that guard against individual moral idealism as well as ridiculing those
with totalising ambitions - perhaps appropriate for a postmodern context where
radical hope lies more in alliances of local practical struggles, campaigns for
self-determination and expressions of class anger. Rather than fantasies of a
unified world proletariat, such a politics may pay more regard to differences
among the poor and oppressed, and the consequent diversity of our potential -
and working towards even more effective meshings than could be achieved, for
example, in the Poll Tax Rebellion or the LA Uprising. In the meantime, the following
(fairly mundane) examples from the last issue of <i>Here and Now</i> show some of the
consequences of prioritising the demands of theory when conducting political
analysis. </p>
<h3>Funny Business: the Interpreting of <i>Class War</i></h3>
<p>If
the above analogy - between professional, managerial and other middle class
discourses and revolutionary doctrines - is not completely spurious (or
mischievous), an unexpected effect of analysing them properly might be that
some hitherto radical perspectives may lose some of their allure, when, for
example, a class-specific disgust and hatred lurking under the purity of
revolutionary rhetoric is exposed. In mapping the development in Britain of the
"autonomous wing of anarchism" ('Revolution as merchandise', <i>Here
&amp; Now</i>
13, p35-37), Nat Turner gives a timely reminder of the Left's shortcomings.
More to the point here is that special kind of contempt reserved by some
radicals for any sign of human weaknesses - such as pleasure gained in and
through aspects of the present evil set-up, or maybe thinking that the
implications of a given situation may be, perhaps, ambiguous (just a little?).
Oh no - that's reformist, even downright reactionary! Sacred theory must be
protected at all costs, even if that means losing any connection to the real world.
If there's joy or anger - it should be a consequence of theoretical analysis
and the righteousness, and self-righteousness, that goes with it, rather than
arising from our sensual engagement with the world and its attendant
frustrations. </p>
<p>The
sheer puritanical zeal of this kind of revolutionary politics runs counter to
all of the irreverence, conviviality and passion - seedbeds of solidarity and
direct action - that characterise so much of the diversity of lower class
cultures across the world and throughout history. Strange, then, to hear this
evangelism called, in the British context, "proletarian
fundamentalism" (Turner, p35) - meaning, presumably, proletarian in the
sense of being on the 'side' of the theoretical proletariat conceptualised by
Marx. Of course, awareness of these theories is utterly absent from working
class communities, whereas some of the down to earth attitudes of Class War,
for some reason, are familiar to many thousands of working class people. </p>
<p>So,
Nat Turner's discussion of Class War's <i>Unfinished Business</i> pinpoints serious
weaknesses in the book, especially its inability to deal with CW's own
historical, geographical and social specificity. However, to write off their
views on class as 'reactionary', refusal of middle class leftist political
correctness (including the "proletarian fundamentalist" varieties) as
"macho", and the robust populism as merely "marketing",
completely misunderstands the wide, complex appeal of the <i>Class War</i> paper and the diversity
of its supporters and members. CW do spend a lot of time sneering at the middle
classes, but their explicit politics defines the bulk of the middle classes as
part of the working class (waged work/subject to extraction of surplus value)
whilst many members and supporters would not count as working class at all
according to such criteria (e.g. underclass or new middle class). Worse, such
fundamental questions are hardly addressed within the organisation. Many
members are confused or have little consciousness of these issues, yet those
who write CW's 'theory', draw up 'business plans' and develop 'rigorous
approaches' react hysterically to comradely debate from CW supporters,
presenting their artificially unified opinions as "the Politics of Class
War". </p>
<p>Nevertheless,
a fairly straightforward exposition of classic anarchism, from a modem working
class perspective, ends up in a glossy paperback stocked by High Street
bookshops, regularly selling out (good pun, eh?). It passes itself off as <i>'The
Politics of Class War</i>',
but it's really the dogmas of a few bores and loudmouths in CW who shout over,
wear down and tire out a more independent, realistic, down to earth and
politically naive membership. The theoretical confusion and political
redundancy of <i>Unfinished Business</i> described by Nat Turner lies in its resort to
classic anarchist and left communist theory, whereas the potential of the CW
phenomenon resulted from bypassing such straightjackets. The view of class in
the book is only reactionary if its gender, race and cultural bias is
generalised to apply universally, having already been tied to archaic marxist
economics. I prefer to interpret this as the effort on the part of some in CW
to establish themselves as leading cadres, via their grasp, use and control of
these particular theories - illustrating the role and principles of operation
of middle class discourses in general. </p>
<p>The
whole episode says little about the CW rank and file except that they were
unable to prevent such manoeuverings, now that the organisation is a revolutionary
organisation along classic anarchist lines. It's a far cry from the
mould-breaking tabloid swagger that spoke to many of our feelings, and went
down a treat with working class people across the country - helped by the
rudimentary politics and refreshing lack of refined theoretical sensitivities.
The CW project began by mobilising working class identity and pride, drawing on
richly varied traditions from working class cultures to describe patterns of
resistance that are and will be equally diverse. But to suit the needs of CW's
theorists, this is transformed into a call for working class cultural unity. Of
course such unity couldn't happen without the obliteration of differences -
unfortunately CW members seem wholly unaware of the implications of this shift
in perspective - they' aren't even sure what they mean by 'working class' at
all, let alone a (singular) 'international working class'. They don't really
want to have to think about it either. </p>
<p>Middle
class politics is forced to attack the directness and vulgarity of working
class behaviour and attitudes, because these are the dimensions of collective
action most resistant to guidance, control or harnessing - the functions middle
class discourses best serve. CW's treatment of 'working class violence' reflects
their debunking of the mainstream political discourses of criminality and
social cohesion. When the category of violence is complicated by questions of
direct bodily engagement as opposed to rationalised detachment, then it has
little to do with working class "virility" being hampered by the
"effete middle class" (Turner, p37). </p>
<p>Middle
class individuals can, of course, be as violent as anyone else, though
associated meanings will usually be gathered into discourses such as legalism,
rights or nationalism. The point is that these ideological underpinnings have
to play down effects of social class, in order to be coherent - middle class
knowledge and action, whether via State institutions or, less concretely, in
scientific, theoretical or 'common sense' understanding. The point is that
although working class people can 'operate' middle class discourses - if less
readily and seamlessly - the institutional practices and material inertia
associated with them can still exert their power in the world, and still need
to be exposed - as <i>Here and Now</i> is trying to do from one set of perspectives,
and as Class War also helped to do from an entirely different starting point.
Class identity, like any other aspects of identity, is fragmentary. It is the
structure and effectivity of a discourse that concerns us in the first
instance, not the 'essence' of those individuals momentarily mohilised by it.
Yet, of course, ideas are not, in themselves, important - only their capacity
to enlist, mobilise and animate strategic groups of people, in deploying
specific material resources. </p>
<p>The
failure to grasp any of the implications of this is evident in the idea that
"action &hellip; instead of talking" (e.g. about gender issues; Turner,
p37) has any relevance to politics (revolutionary or not); or that identity
politics should stick to "unravelling the mish-mash of conditioning"
(ibid). That hoary old dichotomy of mind-language versus body, elaborated into
identity via 'learning', may fit postwar far-left theory, but should otherwise
be relinquished as the anachronism it has been since the sixties. "A
willingness to use violence" may be "a poor guide to political
soundness" (Turner p37, my emphasis), but we know that self defence is no
offence - and to revolutionaries, 'offence' should be no offence either.
Liberal pluralist identity politics, and its tactic of political soundness -
sorry correctness - refer to the lifestyle choices of those whose institutional
positions allow them to disavow the world's unpleasantnesses, while the structures
they serve do the same old business. It's not a case of gratuitously hating
middle class people, but the need to be clear about the dominance of certain
types of discourse (which, more often than not, coincide with middle class
positions). </p>
<p>Similarly,
CW's honest sense of rootedness in specific British working class cultural
environments doesn't have to lead to nationalism, or be denied with illusions
of universality - even if CW's ideologists don't understand this (proved by
their discussions of Ireland and Europe in Unfinished Business). In general the
<i>Class War</i>
newspaper had considerable propagandising potential, which it was able to
fulfil for several years without needing to appeal to or engage with the
agendas, priorities and sensitivities of its near neighbours in far-left
politics.3 These and other political interests respond by
resurrecting the kind of smears4 aimed in the past at Bakunin and
Sorel, among others - expressing an intense fear of collective explosions of
unrest - in particular that these may evade the grasp of the political cadres,
and, more pertinently here, reveal the bankruptcy of theory. Many people would
be relieved to see the end of Class War, not least because its success
threatens to undermine all sorts of "proletarian" pretensions.5
However, a combination of the effects of CW's own 'theorists' (lending
contingent support to equations of populism with demagogic orchestration of
hate), plus the surprisingly intense levels of enmity and contempt from other
revolutionaries for its rashness and vulgarity, have helped to stifle CW's
progress. </p>
<h3>Dream Off</h3>
<p>This
contempt is open in Blob's 'Hot Time on Desolation Row' (<i>Here and Now</i> 13, p7) - an otherwise
valuable and incisive summary of recent patterns of British rioting, most successful
when based on information from local contacts as opposed to playing guessing
games with the inaccuracies of media coverage. But the arrogance referred to
above about the theory and politics of class struggle lead to Blob's comments
(p26) about Amber Films' production of <i>Dream On</i>, commissioned and shot
on the Meadow Well estate in North Shields long before the riots there. The
account given of the film's development, production and reception is in most
respects falsified (bad guesswork?), apparently so as to preclude any analysis
of events other than the predictable left communist rant. It seems most
appropriate to interpret this as reflecting the submission to theory which has
displaced commonality of experience and motivation as the grounds for political
engagement among many revolutionaries. </p>
<p><i>Class
War</i>'s
review of the film (issue 53, p15) did not refer to any of the so-called theory
of <i>Unfinished Business</i>. It was simply one CW member's immediate and emotional
response to the film. Though rather naive about the film's producers, this was
refreshingly free of the pretentious, alienating garbage dragged in by many
'radicals' when they wish to sneer at ordinary folks enjoying something so
blatantly commodified (and admitting it is almost beyond the pale!).
Unsurprisingly, the sneering is rationalised as ideological correctness. So we
learn from Blob that Class War have no 'critique of art', causing the reviewer
(and the editors and entire membership?) to misunderstand the film. Apparently,
not only should a film review be scrutinised for its adherence to doctrine, but
film viewers are supposed to interrogate the motives of its producers before
deciding on whether to laugh at the jokes, empathise with characters or be
engaged by the narrative. I'd like to see Blob trying to convince <i>Dream On</i>'s large and
enthusiastic audiences (huge in the NE) of this - because the film did not
'bomb' at all. Being a Channel 4 TV production, only modest debts were incurred
in printing the film for the cinema - to be repaid when foreign TV rights etc
come in. </p>
<p>This
may be thought too trivial to mention - it's only a film, a media product made
and sold, like any other, according to various institutional and market
constraints. So, why does Blob go to such trouble to trash it? <i>Class War</i>'s reviewer liked the
film partly because it portrayed its chosen aspect of working class culture
accurately, plus it hinted that positive responses to anti-social behaviour and
suffering could be autonomously generated through community links. There was no
sign of any middle class characters or discourses within the narrative (pretty
unusual, eh?), although passion, fantasy and empathy among the characters were
prominent. The screenplay was based on the experiences of women residents of
the Meadow Well estate in a writing group in the mid-80s. Their book6
ends with a copy of a letter to Thatcher, including the words, "We're
amazed you haven't been assassinated yet," plus the polite reply from a
Downing Street minion, ending, "&hellip; your comments have been carefully
noted'! These women had no illusions about the significance or likely effects
of their activities, and were unlikely to be 'recuperated' in any sense. Maybe
CW and I lack a 'critique of literature' too! </p>
<p>The
writing group was self-originated, but only developed the way it did because of
the recuperative efforts of various funders and professionals. For example, the
interests of the group's co-ordinator - as writer, community worker and Amber
Films partner - require a certain intensity of working class suffering and a
supposed inability for this to be expressed positively (let alone in 'art' or
worthy culture) without the ministrations of middle class culture
entrepreneurs. However, the pivotal role in the film narrative - the 'wise woman'
character - is clearly based on the co-ordinator. This identity is mystified in
the narrative as a working class older woman tied organically to the community,
rather than being parachuted in as a paid ‘expert’. </p>
<p>This
crucial manoeuvre allows all of the social and economic relations of production
of the film to be denied. The council can cite a community worker to justify
their image as caring while they get on with the main cuts and yuppification
business at hand. Amber build up their catalogue of documentary realism,
reinforcing their claims of expertise in objectifying, patronising and
rendering as tame the working class communities that they target. Yet all signs
of the institutional networks and forces that plague the real life community
have been purged from the film's narrative. But, this amazing evacuation of
reality, in the passage to fairy tale, allows the fantasy elements of the
narrative (including the wise woman character) their full effect. This level of
paradoxical realism suggests how contradictory and how crucial creative fantasy
may be in working class culture and politics, as a key factor in its resilience
and relative imperviousness to the stultified managed passivity that the
professionals work towards (whether they know it, or like it, or not). </p>
<p>This
double irony reflects the ambivalence of many professional social and community
workers from working class backgrounds. They rely on poverty, oppression and
external imposition for their material security, yet wish-fulfillingly
fantasise that they are really part of the communities they police. If we were
assessing <i>Dream On</i>
from a perspective of measuring the pretensions of its makers against some
ideal revolutionary motives, then "savaging it as &hellip; miserable
recuperative junk" (Blob, p26) makes sense. But to identify so blatantly
with the film's makers (even to slag them off) betrays the bias of
revolutionary proletarian theoreticians, including the fascination with
"drowning people" who "clutch at anything". Meadow Well
residents may be depressed at times, but aren't "drowning".
Condescending charitable attention - whether from radical theorists with
critiques of art, or more conventional sources - is not constructive and will
not be welcomed. <i>Class War</i> may be slated for its populism, but taking the
perspective of the film's viewers allows these traps to be avoided. The
reviewer need not assume a position of superior knowledge - most viewers
couldn't care less about the careers, agonies and postures of film makers, or
their friends and rivals on the left - all competing for the right to know and
represent the truth of working class suffering, claiming a position of
privileged access to its essence. Meanwhile, the CW reviewer accurately
perceived that many working class viewers will have been affected, in some
small way, by this film - either at the pictures or on the telly - but in ways
that media professionals can't have access to - to use, spoil or manipulate.
Most wouldn't even be aware of these effects. Thanks to self-imposed

<p>Unfortunately
<i>Class War</i>'s
editors may have taken on board the left communist-type of critique - perhaps
so as to compete more credibly for status in the anarchist ghetto. A film
reviewed recently was <i>Reservoir Dogs</i> - a Scorcese-style bloodbath movie about as far
from <i>Dream On</i>'s
kind of realism as you could get. The film strips down the usual "phony
macho Hollywood crap" (<i>CW</i> 58, p15) - male bonding in extremes of pain,
terror and death - by forcing several Hollywood styles to their logical
extremes. The glamorous image of careers in serious crime and police
investigation are comprehensively tarnished, whereas the film is saturated not
only with fake blood, but also the dominant media representations (the clothes,
the music, the poses) that associate such danger with sexiness. This is a
clever and powerful film, although designed and marketed as a cult object for
trendy youth and film buffs, rather than for a blockbuster's audience. However,
<i>Class War</i>
no longer seems able to pitch a review at a simple and effective level -
raiding the film text for messages conducive to their own purposes and
trampling all over other contrary meanings in the narratives - as with <i>Batman</i> as assassin, or with <i>Terminator</i> as nemesis of the ruling
classes. Instead the review of <i>Reservoir Dogs</i> hints vaguely at its
"vacuous arguments"; complains that sympathy is evoked for the
"wrong" characters; and ends by calling it a "distasteful"
film. Distasteful &hellip; ?! Yes &hellip; but is it recuperative?! Well, quite. </p>

Today: the Tragi-Comical Paradox (interview with <i>Lutter</i> journal), <i>Solidarity</i>, Issue 17,1988, p7-17;

For example: Stewart Home, <i>The Assault on Culture: Utopian Currents from
Lettrisme to Class War</i>, AK Press 1992; as well as Class War's own <i>Decade of
Disorder</i>,
Verso, 1991, and <i>Unfinished Business: the Politics of Class War</i>, AK Press, 1992. </p>
<p>4.
And the criticisms in <i>Here and Now</i>, which confuse <i>Unfinished Business</i> with CW as a whole, fit
nicely into the agenda of those currently attacking a wide range of
anti-fascist libertarians - an unfortunate irony, given Turner's account of
1970s autonomists and the Anti-Nazi League (<i>Here and Now</i> No. 13, p35). </p>
<p>5.
Not just on the libertarian left, either, e.g.: 'The Passing of an Old Warrior,
<i>Analysis</i>
magazine's sympathetic but premature obituary (early 1993) circulated to CW
groups - presumably hoping for conversions to Leninism? </p>
