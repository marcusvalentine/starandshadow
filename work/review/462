<p>replicant film</p>

<p>Denis Villeneuve’s Blade Runner 2049 (BR49) is a terrible
movie, made by a film maker who has forgotten film and now knows only how to
make walk through installations.</p>

<p>BR 49is an
installation movie dominated by settings and sets, with both action and dialogue set to
ponderous manipulative heavy duty music,much of which sounds like pitch correctedhighly slowed sound.This sound is intended to physically
overwhelm the viewer, and is exploited by Villeneuve in desperation to salvage
the film’s leaden pace.( I also felt
I heard a rendering of the famous ethnographic recording of the drums of Burundi,
incredible rhythmic sound much lifted by film music ‘composers’.)</p>

<p>Frank Capra, a director who understood pace, wrote in his
autobiography: ‘There are no rules in film making but there are sins. And the
cardinal sin is that of dullness.’Villeneuve
has made a very dull movie. and: despite
the music despite the overwhelmingly sycophantic film reviews across the
spectrum, it’s possible the punters may stay away from this boring overlong
unengaging sequel to Scott’s original Blade Runner.</p>

<p>Scott’s original was an expressive vision of Dick’s
hallucinogenic vision of a dysfunctional world dominated by the interests of
the large corporations.A world defined by bloated corrupted
capitalism.Ironically enough Villeneuve
and his producers now seem to regard the Blade Runner franchise as a license for product placement from the great
corporations: Sony, Peugeot, Coca-Cola and in an attempt to try and pass this off
as a joke: Pan-Am!I can’t remember if
the original BR had product placement. But with the concern about role of large
multi national corporations in the world, product placement in BR49 seems
ominous and may explain the comparative tameness of BR49’s social vision.BR49 transforms the replicant social saga
into a story of personalised experience organised about personal identity.</p>

<p>Scott’s original movie worked because in the traditions of
noir movie makers like Hawks, the script and scenario engender close identification with the protagonist:
whether it be a Marlow or a Deckard.The
intensity of the viewers relationship with the ‘anti-hero’ is used to open the
viewer to a clear view of world from a
perspective the viewer understands that they can trust.Whether it be the world of money and corrupted
relations of LA in The Big Sleep; or as in the original Blade Runner the
horrors of an amoral world where men play the role of Gods in creating life and
deciding who lives and who dies. Scott’s
movie works through an originary human dilemma (centred on abuse of power);
whilst not long on humour, it has wit, as in its clever use of origami.</p>

<p>Villeneuve’s BR49 in contrast has no humour (Pan-AM joke
excepted, even if it is a bit of an in-joke for the ex-shareholders) no wit and
its dramatis personae consist of mono dimensional stereo types with haircuts,
who look most of the time like they are going through the motions of obeying
director’s instructions. ( Once actors practiced in front of the mirror; now I
imagine they practice air guitar) Facially for the men this means half tensed
po faced tough look as default; for the women it’s the sort smiling smirk to
camera that ministers to the characters default sense of superiority.Ryan Gosling has nice ears and designer
stubble; the women’s main function is to sport coiffure and series of outfits
appropriate to whatever setting the script diverts them.</p>

<p>With a confused narrative not helped by ridiculously attenuated
dialogue often interspersed with that pitch corrected slowed down music, there
is in fact no story. Story disappears; replaced for the audience by a series of
walk through experiences of different settingsoften replete with water ripple effects, just to make sure nothing stays
still.Film death by a thousand sets;
presumably on the premise that people will watch anything as long as it is visually
and audibly overwhelming. Accompanied
by our latterday would be Beethoven sound track builders, we have: vast domes aplenty mostly menacing, giant
Chinese(?) rubbish tips, old steel mills (Hungary?)vast old Hotels complete with Presley and
Sinatra holograms, endless city scapes, huge sculpture parks, burnt out
landscapes and a sea storm finale.The
problem is by the finale no one understands anything or cares.But we <i>have</i>
walked through a lot of stuff.</p>

<p>Denis Villeneuve is one of a group of contemporary film
directors who has nothing to say but is a dab hand at sententious bloated
gorged sfx driven movies.Villeneuve
demonstrates his ability to conduct and co-ordinate the labour of thousands of
SFX slaves to create the vast settings against which to place his characters.The trouble is that the sets and settings
overwhelm everything, including the idea
of identity at the core of the script.Villeneuve in BR49 does not know
how to effectively energise this vastness of SFX effort with a governing theme,
a set of interplaying and interwoven concepts that can shape characters to whom
an audience can relate.</p>

<p>Perhaps he should go back and have a look at some of Capra’s
films.</p>
