<p>Hors de Loi ( Outside the Law)Rachid Boucharab (Fr 2010) Jamil Debbaya, Roschdy Zem, Sami
Bouailla.</p>
<p>Viewed National Film Theatre London:10 07 2012,Ticket : £ 5.00</p>

<p>Everything comes out in the wash</p>

<p>Boucharab’s (RB) concern is to caste Hors de Loi (HL) as a
validating vehicle for the Algerian revolution, lendingfilmic authority to fictive
revolutionary archetypes and associative characters.As such it is an exercise that in itself dramatises the
inevitable fate of revolutions as the moss of history clings to them, the
movement from the polemic and political to the fake melodramatics of the soap
opera.HL is more melodrama than
political history.</p>

<p>However it is the principle setting of HL that is its most
noteworthy characteristic.</p>

<p>Although the action moves back and forth between Algeria and
Paris, it is Paris that presents as the real location of the film.Not as a background but as a setting of
signification. It is this setting that gives RB’s film a contemporary resonance
that stands on firmer ground thanits claim to either emotion or historical authenticity.HL’s main action does not take
place in remote Algiers but in ‘near’ Paris.Interpenetration of peoples is the underlying theme.In HL the war in Algeria is depicted as
being played out in its own right, on its own terms, in the capital of
France.Algerians were not some
far away people.They and their
struggle, their goals and aspirations, whether consciously articulated or not,
were immediate and present even if hidden away in the bidonville of Nanterre,
the late shifts of Renault car factories and shady bars.In Paris, as in the rest of
Europe it is the unseen peoples of Africa and Eastern Europe who do the work.Often exploited in neo colonial
relationships, if they cannot make themselves heard legitimately, they are
close enough to make themselves felt. It is not possible to disconnect the
conditions which these people have left, from the conditions in which they live
amongst us.</p>

<p>Other then its close to home settingHL offers nothing in itself as
film.It presents as medium
through which to plough a chronology that takes its main characters from rural
Algeria in 1925 to Paris in 1962.It is a sort of break neck charge through significant dates in Algeria’s
anti colonial history.The speed
and broken nature of the film’s time line betrays the complexity of events to a
narrative device.The device
stitching RB’S sprawling material together comprises of the ‘follow’ mechanism:
follow the three brothers.Three
Algerian brothers are the core of film’s scenario and they are tracked through
their relationship both with the forces of the age and their relationship with
each other. </p>

<p>The problem with this mechanism in film is that the end
product is usually pure surface: all the energy of the film is expended on
stapling together the complexities of the surface relations: history and
personal relationships. In this HL calls to mind Lean’s Dr Zhivago a failure in
everything other than its good looks and memorable theme tune: otherwise
essentially empty.A vacuous
statement that was unable to point the viewer further than Jarre’s ‘Lara’s
Theme’ , used with indecent frequency to hold together the whole bag of
collapsing affects and events. </p>

<p>We watch events unfold.In this type of structure where outcome is known, there is
no tension working through the scenario, working through the deeper grain of
the material.Conflict, tactical
and strategic and ambiguities are at the core of every political endeavour, but
the tensions which they create often only become visible when a different phase
of operations commences.RB
has tailored his script to avoidreal tensions relating to ends and means, tensions involving Islam and
the FLN.The script’s
set up of the three brother mechanism is exploited to indicate tensions: the
opposition of ends and means that arises between two of the brothers Abdulkadir
and Messaoud.But the latter’s
initial distaste and personal disinclination to use the garrotte as an
extrajudicial means of capital punishment is resolved all too easily; as is
Said’s(the third brother)
resistance to the FLN interfering with his boxing promotion.</p>

<p>To generate tension, having decided to eschew interpersonal
fraternal conflict, RB relies on the tried and tested set piece of action.This revolves about violence and fire
fights: the killing of rivals of political factions, the assassination set
piece and the attempted military style operation.These events arecathartic male film rituals familiar from wargangster and sci figenres.The extended use by
RB of action sequences particularly in the Paris setting reduces HL to an
action genre rather than claiming HL as a significant political interpretent.</p>

<p>With other possibilities RB makes of his film a series of
events, rather than a process, to the detriment ofHL which had the potential ini ts setting and in the forces
it depicts, to be a different kind of film.</p>
