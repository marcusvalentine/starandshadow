<p>Amy: the girl behind the nameAsif Kapadia (UK 2015) Janis: Little Girl
BlueAmy Berg (USA 2015)</p>

<p>Beware films bearing colons: in their titles.</p>

<p>Film is one means of probing a truth content of a subject
matter.Although documentary and drama
framed movies (and there are hybrid types of doc/dramas) are different approaches
are there particular characteristic features that distinguish them from each
other? </p>

<p>Watching Amy and Janis,two feature docs, made me think about the differences between drama and doc
as film expression.Documentaries seem to
be a particular type of film expression that lays claim to the actual.But documentary films in relation to: subject
matter, contents, structure and even form are often substantially the same as
drama.So, what of a film like Kapadia’s
Amy whose content comprises only of actual documented footage and archive
material without any externalities of input such as voice over or extranuous music.
You might think that produced in this form using only originary primary
material that Amy’s expressive content makes it completely distinct from any
drama based production.</p>

<p>However it might be possible to make a film, that used only
actual material originating as documentary or archive recordings, whose purpose
was to produce an intentional fabrication.You might call such a film a piece of
propaganda (Riefenstahl’s work for Hitler) or perhaps a fabricated documentary
and the latter type of production would almost certainly borrow heavily from
dramatic form to fabricate its story, and to that extent would present many of
the markers of a drama in making its claim to present truth content.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In relation to Kapadia’s ‘Amy: the girl behind the name’,
this is the sort of claim that has been made by some of her family. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The overwhelming pressure on film makers from distributors
producers commissioners is to have a strong story line.Narrative is king.So both drama and documentary types of film
have to conform.To find the line
through the material that best delivers a story.To disregard elements that don’t fit the
story, to draw out their characters in those expressive clips that clearly
define their role in the story.This
pressure is most strongly exerted on contemporary documentary makers, looking
for theatrical release, whose editing of originatory material now has to comply
with the rules of dramatic form.</p>

<p>Both Amy and Janis conform to the pre-packaged populist
narrative of the tragedy of the flawed female performer.The message that female emotional frailty
combined with isolation and inability to cope with the ravaging demands made by
the image of success, lead on to recourse to drinkdrugs and death.Both films in their different ways package
this story and present it as the primary truth content without too much complication
or digression.</p>

<p>The music of Janis
and Amy is folded into the warp of both films.Music which is intense and personal, expressive of states of mind
embedded in the films, but not necessarily definitive of either singers’
life.</p>

<p>It is perhaps in the expectations of the audience, rather
than form, that documentary and dramatic material may be significantly
different.Audiences for films presented as docs are more
concerned with the truth content of the material.Audiences for drama,more concerned with dramatic effect.</p>

<p>Dramatic productions are subject I think to different
criteria of appraisal by their audiences.In dramatic performances, actors are appraised for their bodies, their
physiques, their voices, the delivery of their lines (sincere, authentic) and
their mimicking abilities. In dramatic scripts the audience is happy to
accept a large measure of dramatic license in the film scenario. Dramas are understood as fabrications.For
the audience the issue is whether at some level the drama can be understood as
sincere and authentic.</p>

<p>In a film presented as a documentary, the audience attends
the material with a different subjectivity.In docs the makers and contributors are judged almost exclusively for
their honesty.In the
documentary film the audience to some extent play a forensic role, almost a
type of jury, examining the film looking for signs confirming the veracity, the
relatedness, the frankness, the repleteness and moral stature of interviewees
and material as it is presented </p>
<p></p>
<p>Amycomprises an overwhelming intimacy.The film consists of home movie footage,
archive and selfie material: a door, an opening into Amy’s life.It presents as intrusion: like looking through someone’s diary or going
through their room. The mood created is one of privileged access to the private
sphere, a construed invasion of
privacy.The film, reinforced with Amy’s self
referential songs defines the mood of its expressive material shaping it into a
tragedy, that entwined emotionally with her music, tells the story of the
inevitable rise decline and death of Amy Whitehouse. </p>

<p>Berg’s ‘Janis…’ also makes use of archive and personal
footage.At the core of the film’s
narrative drive are the songs, interpreted and reinformed by extensive use made
of interviews with those who knew and worked with her.The songs speak for themselves: the emotional
authenticity of the story of‘Janis’.But the interviews seem
to me less satisfactory.They all
conform to the expected image of Janis, and come across as perspectives of the
past seen through the filter of the present.A present where the hot issues of the past, its conflicts and
antagonisms, have all comfortably melded.The interviews seem to reconstruct an idealised version of Janis that
seems at odds with an actual Janis, a demanding out of control hurricane of
life.</p>

<p>Both Amy and Janis are formulaic but each offers a quite
difference experience of subjectivity to the viewer. Amy asks the viewer to
conspire with the film makers conceit that their film allows them to understand
the music by allowing them into the domain of the private. Janis, keeps the
viewer on the outside of the material, asking them to understand the music by
believing the word of a number of interviewees talking many years after the
events they are remembering.</p>
