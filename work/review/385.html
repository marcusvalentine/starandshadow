<p><span>Dawn
of the Planet of the ApesMatt Reeves
(USA 2014)Gary Oldham. Keri Russell,
Andy Serkis</span></p>
<p><span>Viewed:2D release at Empire Cinema Newcastle UK;
ticket £7.50</span><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0716257/?ref_=tt_ov_dr"></a><span></span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>White
man speak with forked tongue</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Delightful
it is to see our simian cousins swing through the trees from branch to branch
and in distressed pseudo-Gothic buildings, from beam to beam.There are moments of visual allure in the
film but they barely compensate for an overall feeling of staleness of its
ideas and its filmic reliance on the vacuity of the affect images that are
overused in an attempt to implicate/absorb the audience in the state of mind of
Caesar the Heap Big Chief Ape. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Reeves’
Ape Dawn project actually seems to have stalled at the conceptualisation stage,
a creative inability to establish the ‘Ape world’ beyond the stereotypes associated
with the Noble Savage. Visually the Apes
look move and rock and roll like monkeys, but conceptually they behave and
respond as reborn Native Americans, Red
Injuns in old money, caste out of old discredited Hollywood simplifications.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>There
is nothing deeply alien or other in these Ape creatures.When they break out of their own
communication code/language and speak English, they do so in the gruff manneristic
way of the Apache in Stagecoach.‘Ape
not kill Ape!’The way in which the Apes
live together as one tribe, is Indian not animalso that when we see the Ape’s camp with its
many fires, it looks like the scene from the Comache camp in the Searchers. And the ‘Dawn’ Apes unlike actual animals
have a socio-political organisation based about the one leader, the Big Chief,
which may be true for some Native American tribes but is not true for simian
organisation.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>These
creatures aren’t monkeys: Dawn is backdoor reinvention of the Western, a sort
of redressed homage to the gold age of the genre.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Even
visually the Apes resemble the Injuns of old:theirrib sections picked out in
white, like Sioux war breast plates.The
way the Apes ride their horses without stirrups looks like the image on the front
cover of my copy of Bury my Heart at Wounded Knee. In the emotional tone of
their responses, the Apes are American Native replicants. There is nothing
intrinsically amiss in all this except for its predictability and the loss of a
response spectrum that is animal not Disney anthropomorphic.</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span>To
drive the narrative of ‘Dawn…’ the scripting
department was unable to come up with anything more that a transposed Western
Indian story which seemed so familiar I felt I’d seen it many times before. The
story of the good leader, discredited in his relations with outsiders,
overthrownand (nearly)slain by the
upstart wannabe who then leads his people against the white man before being in
turn defeated by the return of the true leader.It’s a variation on the Fort Apache script. The Apes even have a full frontal charge into
the coral against the guns of the good town people. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Dawn
of the Planet of the Apes points to the creative hollow that underlies movies
built on SFX.There is so much effort
and cost expended in verisimilitude, in getting the wow factor going, that
there is less investment in working out how to exploit the possibilities of
this material in a scripting dynamic.Perhaps the huge expense involved (there were 1000’s of sfx workers
credited) means the producers usually decide to play safe and opt for a
straight concept backed by narrative characterised by simple devices and roles
everyone can relate to.Fair enough, but
it also seems something of a wasted opportunity to extend the extraordinary
feat of the SFX into another conceptual dimension.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>As
the film progresses it seems to become increasingly important to Matt Reeves
that we ‘get’ the chimps as ‘affect’ creatures.Consequently this means that the
audience are subjected to long big close-ups of the Apes’ faces, close-ups
characterised by immobility of the features.In fact these shots are mostly of Caesar as he is the central
player.These long durational shots are
supposed to make an affect image of his face so that the audience absorbed by
Caesar’s immobility intraject their own states of mind onto his face so
supplying an inducted internality to his character.Whilst this mode of shot can be highly
affective, I don’t think it works very well in Dawn of the Apes.There is something in the Ape mask that
resists human affective intrajection.But even if it might have worked once as a shot, the multiplication of
the series of shots of Caesars face in Big Close Up exhausts the affect
circuitry leaving only banality.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>And
banality is the mood music of Dawn, and of course the plot is nicely set up for
a sequel of more of the same.</span></p>
