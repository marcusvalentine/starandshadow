<p>Love means never having to say you’re sorry…</p>

<p>Seeing two sci-fi films in the space of  a couple of weeks,  first one was ‘Arrival’,
brings home how sci-fi movies are in general little more than a transmutation
of current contemporary issues onto an
imagery future.The shift in situation
and imagery towards the futuristic gives ongoingpolitical and social themes a thinly disguised
aspect. This can sometimes, lend
freshness to debate (rare but it happens), and/or open up the subject matter to the
possibilities of satire and parody.Woody Allen, J-P Godard and Mel Brookes have all tested out this latter
territory. </p>

<p>Villeneauve’s ‘Arrival’ establishes the familiar situation
of an alien landing on Earth, but takes as its area of concern notconflict as in ‘War of the Worlds’, but
rather thesubject of communication.On reflection I came to think that ‘Arrival’s
scenario was actually a variant on the theme: ‘Women are from Venus’. Its subject matter, in subtext of course, was
actually communication between the sexes, men and women.‘Arrival’s’ big idea was that women, such as
feminists who have difficulties in speaking or communicating with men, should
use white boards.Armed with a white board, you can say and then you can point. Although the white board
does not rule out misunderstandings, perhaps it makes them less frequent than
they would otherwise be.Seriously.</p>

<p>‘Passengers’on the
other hand does not take itself seriously. It is tongue in cheek spoof on the
American dream of the perfect relationship between the sexes as blazed
idealised and trailed by teenage magazines such as True Romance, its ilk and imitators
(Disney Corp).Filled out with tropes
from just about every significant sci-fi movie of the last fifty years, Tyldum
absorbs and regurgitates (with effective SFX) just about everything from robots
spaceships and spacescapes.As we
journey on Avalon we visit: Forbidden Planet, 2001, Star Trek, Star Wars,
Alien, Gravity possibly even Solaris and I presume other movies I’ve not
seen.But the sci fi input is just a
wrap, a expensively formulated wrap, often spectacular, but just a wrap to sell
and to promote the film. The subject
matter is simply a variant on the old story of: boy meets girl. </p>

<p>The first section of the film covers Jim’s accidental
awakening which allows Tyldum’s scenario to create situations satirising the contemporary
frustration of trying to communicate with corporate entities fronted by layers
of robotic gate keepers.But although
the menace of corporatestrategies in controlling our lives is
maintained in the script, this opening section is simply an hors d’oeuvre
preparing for the subsequent determined parody that defines the action of
Passengers. </p>

<p>Tyldrum book-ends Passengers with Sleeping Beauty motifs. In the first part of the film when Jim wakes
Aurora, it seems as if Passengers might be some sort of gloss on the familiar
Grimms Bros/Disney fairy tale.But rigorously
rooted in contemporary mores, Passengers is committed to gender equality; the Sleeping Beauty moment is a feint but one
that allows the movie to show its contemporary gender equality credentials by
having a gender balanced moment at the end of the film where Aurora wakens
Jim.Symmetry. </p>

<p>So the awakening of Aurora in Passengers does not presage a
fairy tale. It is in fact a Lubitsch meet-cute situation with one of the
parties, as is not usual, contained, and believing the meet-cute has been accidental
not manipulated.Tyldrum uses the
relationship between Jim and Aurora to satirise both the content and form of
the contemporary career of the romance.Isolating his love birds on the good ship Avalon gives Tyldum the space
to spoof the ‘love ideology bond’ as pitched by Disney and teenage
magazines.The pitch that love conquers
all (even betrayal), lovers exist only for each other to the exclusion of the
world, love is forever and exists in a sort of vacuum chamber bereft of social
or cultural ties.</p>

<p>The lonely vast spaceship Aurora is a very good filmic
testing ground to have fun at the expense of these jejune ‘lurve’ propositionsand to look at the infantalisation of relationships
in contemporary culture as adolescence is stretched out into mature
adulthood.Tyldum rapidly works through
the formulaic relationship models suggested by: Blind Date, Big Brother, I’m a
Celebrity Get me Out of here!He checks
into the getting to know you rituals as formulated in every Rom-Com: the sport
(Annie Hall) , the swank dinner out, the disco, and of course the BED.They are a couple in love without a care in
the world, and it so wonderful that young people can get on with their lives in
this sort of difficult marooned situation. They are enough for each other, they don’t
need other people. Tyldum’s script and
scenario doesn’t play it for laughs, not even knight errant one liners, but as
the film progresses the power of the satire plays deeper into the movie,
cutting though the spectacle which becomes ever more a ridiculous over the top appendage
to the course of true love. </p>

<p>Like all tru-love
stories, particularly those written by observant teenage girl diarists, Passengers ends happily ever after.Our
lovers Aurora and Jim overcome all the obstacles to love,living alone, self sufficient and in mutual
blissful contentment to the end of their days.Obviously it was always meant to be this way.It was written in the stars.<span> Or perhaps a computer.  </span>Horray!</p>
