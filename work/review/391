<p>TimbuktuAbderrahmane Sissako (Mauritania / Fr 2014 )Ibrahim Ahmed<b></b></p>
<p><span>Viewed: Quad CinemaNYC USA;2nd March 2015;Ticket: $12</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Where
to run….?Only to death&hellip; ? ….and Allah?</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Sissako’s
‘Timbuktu’ opens and closes with running shots. The film opens with a mute
tracking shot of a gazelle fleeing through desert scrub from the Ansar Dine (Islamist
fundamentalists) fighters who have taken control of the Timbuktu area.In the final shot Toya, the herders’ daughter
who we have just seen orphaned by the Ansar Dine, runs gasping with despair towards the camera. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Neither
the gazelle nor Toya have any future, both are quarry.The gazelle’s future we know: it will
be run down until exhausted and then have its throat slit.Toya’s future is also certain. With no one to
protect her she will be captured and either killed or forcibly married to a
fighter, one of whom has been circling her mother even when her mother was
protected by her father Kadir.When Kadir is killed by Ansar Dine, Toya’s
life has ended,: it is difficult to see any future for her.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>I
think it is this notion of the future that constitutes the question that
inspires Sissako’s film. </span></p>
<p><span>And
it is a question that is put into relief by one extraordinary shot in the
middle of the film.Viewed from a promontory
we see a big wide view of the river.Kasim has just had a fight in the river with the fisherman and
accidently shot him.The river is
shallow and slow moving, not more than a meter deep.On the right hand side of frame we see the
prone body of the fisherman. Whilst to his left, Kadim exhausted wades across
to the left hand side river bank away from the dying man, who staggers up for a
few paces before his final collapse.The river flows through the increasing gap between the two men, the
alive and the dead.The river flows
through the shot opening up space for us to think about the nature of the forces
that we have seen unleashed in the early part of the film, and wondering how
these forces will be respond to this event: a killing. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>I
think this river shot is the key shot in the Timbuktu scenario.I think Sissako inserted as a key shot: the
conjuction of the eternal and the flowing, the sometime terrifying vicissitudes of the
everyday within which we have to live. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>In
‘Timbuktu’ (the film) the people experience change in the very grain of their
lives.But strangely enough not to the
rhythm of life. The people are exemplified
by the small family of herders, Kadim, Satima and Toya, about whom a
significant section of the film revolves.They live under canvas with their
small herd of cattle.Enriched with music that has become illicit their
life, is rhythmic and honest.Sissako lets us see through them the intense
beauty of beings integrated both with themselves and their environment.And almost from the first time we see them we
know that they are doomed.Foredoomed by the merciless forces that have
now entered their lives and will inevitably destroy them.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>The
people we see in ‘Timbuktu’ are only a small group but representative of the
millions of people whose lives have been destroyed and smashed up by the emergence
of a strain of ruthless intolerant fundamentalist Islam that has developed and
advanced as a moral religious political and social force across huge swathes of
the Middle East, Africa and Asia.‘Timbuktu’ is an intimate portrayal of the forces at work in the
particular context of Mali society and the dessert landscape which has formed
and shaped human relations through many ages.But here as everywhere the question raised is what happens next? How will the living adopt and come to terms
with life under a new and uncertain order.What resources are needed to go on living? </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Sissako’s
film is set in Timbuktu (but not shot in the town itself) and its surrounding
countryside.The country landscape with
its quality of the eternal,the
townscape with its quality of an ancient and unchanging focus of life, are both
subjected to brutal usurpation by alien forces.The town occupied, the
countryside penetrated. The town people
subject to an regime of intolerance imposed with religiously legitimised
certainty and defined by extreme punishment.The country people where once they watched their animals the wind and the
stars now watch out for the arrival of the new Masters the enforcers of the new
order.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Sissako’s
scenario captures the adaptations made by the people to the sudden imposition
of series of absolute laws.In a series
of surreal cameos we see people clinging to the outward form of previous
enjoyments whilst having to forego their essence: ‘air’ music without music,
football played without the ball.The
odd illusion of the rhythm of life unchanged but everyting changed. The new
order, proclaimed in the streets, is particularly aimed at the repression of
women’s presence in the public domain, neither women’s hands nor their feet may
be seen, socks and gloves have to be worn at all times.But the women represented by Sissako when
threatened are not cowed.They return
the gaze of the men as equals.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>And
it at this point that Sissako’s film seems to illuminate something about the
way in which violent extremist groups interact and operate with captured populations.Their occupation centres on an ‘Allah’
discourse, and their claim to legitimate
power by representing the will of ‘Allah’.Timbuktu is an ongoing and substantive discourse relating to the nature
of Allah and Islam and the claim by groups like Ansar Dine to legitimise their
power in relation to: people’s
activities, the status of women and the
practice of Sharia Law.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>One
of the opening scenes is a debate between an Imam of Timbuktu and a religious
spokesmen for the new order.The Mullah simply
cannot accept the extremist interpretation and practice of Islam: he does not
recognise it for it is in essence without mercy.But
the extremist position is that justice is literally for Allah,they simply carry out his will.The jihadist sentiment similar in portent to
the words of the blood thirsty Christian Bishop, justifying massacre at the
siege of Beziers: “God will recognise his own.”</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>So
it is a Law without mercy that is practiced upon the people, a practice that is
reminiscent of the early days of young
zealot commissars touring the USSR bringing soviet ‘justice’ to the furthest
reaches of the Empire.The new order the
Ansar Dine do not shout bully or enforce in an individually expressive statement
of power.Their justice is a quiet insistance.The extreme discourse mediates itself through
practice of the ‘law’.The occupying
militants are channels of the will of Allah.The brutality, the stoning the whipping the executions are carried
through with silent resolve: legitimate sentences of Islamic law. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>In
‘Timbuktu’ Sissako carefully exposes the claims of the Islamists to represent
the pure practice of Islam.The
extremists cannotanswer the opposing
point of view of the local Imam except by force.As the occupation proceeds to impose itself,
cultural and racial splits are exposed.The occupiers whatever legitimacy they claim, can only impose their will
through the application of legalised terror.The primacy of the sexual desires exposed among the young hoodlums as
they forcibly take wives for themselves by right of conquest not consent.And in the central theme of the film,the Sharia law through which they claim
legitimacy is itself shown to be a façade, a cover for hypocritical carnality. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>The
herds people, representitive of harmony and beauty are destroyed.The head of the small family, Kadir is
sentanced to death for killing a man in a fight, perhaps accidently in self
defence.At his ‘trial’ under Sharia,
the commutation of the death sentence was set impossibly high by the demand
(for thirty cattle when he only has seven) for blood money compensation he does
not posess. As he cannot not meet the
bloodmoney he must die. The impossible demand
almost certainly stems from the extremist’s second in command’s desire to
possess Kadir’s wife Satima.A desire
not possible to fulfil as long as Satima is married to Kadir.Once Kadir is dead, then she and their
daughter Toya can be taken. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Realising
this and knowing that she has been betrayed by Ansar Dine exploitation of
Sharia to get rid of her husband so that one of their commanders can take her,
Satima joins her husband at his execution, immediately dieing with him in the
hail of bullets that greet her arrival.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Sissako’s
film has been accused of not being critical enough of the Islamist
extremists.But Sissako is not making a
Hollywood action movie.He also knows
that depictions that misrepresent what happens are counterproductive.The
militants are as they are, by their own lights lawful. Sissako has made a film that is in accordance
with what is experienced: that extremist fundamentalism is partly a legitimacy
issue, and that the ‘Allah’ discourse, and the corruption innate in claiming
monopoly of truth and mercy, is where the extremists can be defeated. </span></p>
