<p>A Matter of Life and DeathPowell and Pressburger (UK 1946 )David Niven, Kim Hunter</p>
<p>Viewed: DVD11 April
2015</p>

<p>Retrocrit: only truth is a matter of life and death</p>

<p>In re-evaluation of their work Powell and Pressburger have
emerged out of the relative obscurity of British Cinema to lay claim (both
collectively and individually in the case of Powell) to a certain stature in
the history of film.A significance
perhaps.Specifically Martin Scorsese
has cited Red Shoes as influential on his personal development as a film
maker.</p>

<p>But what of the critique’s of Powell and Pressburger made by
continental critics and filmmakers who have viewed examined and evaluated these
film makers?These critics have looked
for those qualities in film that made it the expressive medium of the age: the
knife cutting through to the quick of cultural and social heart of the twentieth
century, the era of the image.</p>

<p>The contributors to Cahiers du Cinema and others have
generally passed over the work of Powell and Pressburger, in silence.On viewing A Matter of Life and Death I can understand the cause of their silence.I think this silence emanates from a sense of
unease about the core motivations that certainly underlie Matter of Life and
Death and to an extent their other films. </p>

<p>The surface of their film work is beautiful.It presents as a filmic equivalent of haute
couture, turned out like a beautiful model strutting the cat walk displaying garments
of colour line and texture.In Life and Death
the camera work is wonderfully fluid:movements
are sometimes spectacular as with the tracks where the camera pulls back to
reveal the size and scale of the celestial reception area and the Court room;sometimes intimate as per the track through
the Doctor’s library.The camera movement
has purpose connecting the audience either to scale or to character, it reveals
something we should see.The camera
movement is part of the film as are the sets: the intimate cockpit of the
doomed Lancaster, the epic Stairway/escalator to the heavens.The sets encompass the characters and and
have a magical theatrically that holds the audience within their thrall.</p>

<p>But concealed beneath the films model surface there is the
nagging feeling that Matter of Life and Death is rotten at its core: it has no
truth value. It is a lie foisted on its
audience. </p>

<p>It claims to be a film about love: a love passion conceived
at the moment of death.</p>
<p>But as a love story even for the times it is devoid of
passion,when Niven and Hunter look at
each other, you see the directors instructions not desire.Compared with the passion evinced by Trevor
Howard and Celia Johnson in Brief Encounter, then June and Peters’ feelings are
a strangely mechanical scripted love affair.</p>

<p>The image that captures the filmshow June and Peter together, but not looking
at each other; rather looking off into the middle distance as if they had
stepped out of some Soviet agit prop vehicle imploring the workers to build
better tractors. </p>

<p>The audience response asks a question: if this is not love,
but something mechanical, then what is the machine?</p>

<p>It was a political machine.An administration that needed to address the problem of maintaininggood relations between Great Britain and the
USA at a critical moment at the end of the War.One threat to these relations was the simmering popular discontent about
US servicemen  using greater wealth and alluring glamour of America, to
woo bed and take away British women.The priority was to do try and prevent an incident that might escalate
out of control.Part of the answer lay
in propaganda whose object would be to de-intensify this issue, to reframe
it.And Powell and Pressburger had shown
themselves adept propagandists, not just for the war effort but in their uncritical
and sanctimonious embrace of all things British:her Empire and moral code.</p>

<p>Matter of Life and Death is not about love as such, its
about message, a message that justifies love between British and
Americans.The core of the film is not
passion but a quasi legalistic pleading for the sanctity of love between
‘others’ – Brits and Yanks. Powell and Pressburger reverse gender/ sexual roles
from the actual pressure issue of American men claiming British women: in this
case Peter – Brit and Joan - Yank. This is a deintensifying scripted strategy
allowing cultural inequalities to be stripped out of the chemistry, but this
new paradigm still allows the process of legitimising US/Brit relations to take
centre stage.</p>

<p>Which it duly does in its celestial afterlife setting.</p>

<p>At this point the film loses both pace and rhythm as it
focuses onseries of arguments played
out in judicial arena before a collective audience of the allied nations of the
world with a symbolically critical jury of Americans selected to decide whether
a good Bostonian girl should be allowed to have a relationship with a Brit
airman.It’s a convoluted shananagem, a
piece of glamorised Agitprop.</p>

<p>Powell and Pressburger’s films often have a disturbing
repressed core, a terror of the flesh. This psychic constant works through all
of the movies (culminating in Powell’s Peeping Tom which of course has a German
protagonist).The other constant as
referred to above was their uncritical embrace of all things British.Britain is festooned in their movies as a
magically blessed land inhabited by gentle decent folk of the shire, rarely
stirred to anger, but when so stirred are implacable in their search for
justice. </p>
<p>
And the more you look at this Disneyesque vision, the more it seems to be
either a lie or the product of filmmakers totally cocooned in an unreal world
of privilege, filmmakers unable to use their eyes to see anything that is
happening around them.Liars or
fantasists, or some admix of both of these.</p>

<p>And this is the reason for the silence of critics.Powell and Pressburger are unable, even in
the slightest detail of scenario or scripting to countenance any other
proposition than that Britain is the most benign and best of all possible
worlds.An untruth raised in their films
to series of propagandist images.</p>

<p>Technically Powell and Pressburger’s films, including of
course matter of Life and Death create resonant and powerful streams of
images.Perhaps like adverts.But like adverts they are untrustworthy
images, propagated by a belief system whose purpose is to sell a lie. </p>
