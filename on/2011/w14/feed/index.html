The Paper Jam Comics Collective join up with the Star &amp; Shadow's own Canny Little Library to bring this year's International Mini Comics day to Newcastle.

Everyone can make a mini comic, and it only uses up one piece of paper! So come along, all ages &amp; drawing styles welcome - no formal charge but a small donation is appreciated for the use of the building and the photocopier.

Everyone's finished mini comics will be photocopied and shared around, so all you have to do is draw one, and you might end up going home with 50!</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/436</guid></item><item><title>Screen Printing Workshop</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/450</link><description>Alongside the Canny Little Library a small, free, screen printing workshop will be run.
