30th June 2011 may well turn out to be the most important step forward in a mass fight against public sector cuts. Hundreds of thousands of workers could be involved in strike action, from as many as four or five different unions including NUT, PCS, UCU and ATL.
Often strike action can be ignored by those in power but also the vast majority of workers not in unions or directly effected by the issues. Therefore we, rank &amp; file union members, students, precarious workers &amp; unemployed are calling for a mass show of solidarity for those taking strike action and to generalise the strike on June 30th.
From early morning pickets, direct actions, occupations &amp; demonstrations - whatever you're into - lets all do it on June 30th and amplify the resistance to austerity. This call to action is going out to activist direct action groups, local anti cuts groups, radical political groups, radical unions and student university occupations.
