He will be presenting 2 films made with maximalist musician Charlemagne Palestine, who wowed us during AV10. He'll also show Faux Movements, a film which attempts to act on the neurons in the brain responsible for perception of motion to make us see things that aren't on the film. All in glorious 16mm.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/457</guid></item></channel></rss>
