New volunteers to support with practising English (and making tea!) always welcome. No experience necessary, volunteers can assist with answering questions, chatting and offering more individual support in smaller group activities. We try and make the sessions inclusive, welcoming and anti-discriminatory.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/577</guid></item><item><title>Jeremy Marre's REGGAE BRITANNIA plus Funky Butt Club</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/454</link><description>Marre’s stunning history of reggae in Britain includes Aswad, Laurel Aitken, Misty in Roots, the Cimarons, Matumbi, the Specials and more.
