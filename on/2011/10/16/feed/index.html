The film shows the dirty side of so-called 'clean' nuclear energy. Where uranium comes from,where it goes to and what is left behind. The film takes us to Australia to the world's largest uranium mine and to Europe where this source of 'clean energy' is a gold mine for the energy corporations.
The film will be followed by speakers for and against nuclear power.
