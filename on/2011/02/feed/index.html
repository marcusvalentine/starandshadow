Money Can't Buy Me Love.
Richard Harris stars as the gauche-hard as nails, "kick my teeth in would you" ,
rugby league player who finds that indeed 
money can't buy him love with his landlady, 
played by Rachel Roberts.
 Also starring William Hartnell as the talent spotter with
a love for the game and more.
