Money Can't Buy Me Love.
Richard Harris stars as the gauche-hard as nails, "kick my teeth in would you" ,
rugby league player who finds that indeed 
money can't buy him love with his landlady, 
played by Rachel Roberts.
 Also starring William Hartnell as the talent spotter with
a love for the game and more.
  Anderson perfectly captures life in the 
  "it's grim up north" 1960s  with a completely unsentimental eye.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/753</guid></item><item><title>NEW VOLUNTEER INDUCTION</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/394</link><description>Come along and find out more about your favourite DIY cinema, and how to get involved.
