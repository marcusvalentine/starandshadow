Thankfully, those debauched harlots at Sounds of Seduction have invented Divine Trash, a celebration of cheap wigs, music and make up.

Not only will we be crowning MISS ALTERNATIVE NEWCASTLE, we'll be premiering DIVINE TRASH, a documentary that explores the early career of filmmaker John Waters, and his relationship with Divine.

The evening will also feature Britain's only transgender punk band, Women in Revolt. 

DJs THE MARK OF KANE and THE VILE MISS PEARS will provide bubblegum punk and garage rock and they promise to blow your wig off, especially as ENTRY IS FREE to trashy types who arrive in a wig before 9.00pm!</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/483</guid></item><item><title>Hamlet Rehearsal - Cinema</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/643</link><description>07816 778899</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/643</guid></item><item><title>Canny Little library</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/611</link><description>The Canny Little Library is the best library in the star and shadow/ city / uk for books, zines and pamphlets with a focus on titles with a more critical stance towards the society we live in and not available in most regular libraries/ bookshops.
