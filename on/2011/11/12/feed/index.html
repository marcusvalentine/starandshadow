Everyone welcome!</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/412</guid></item><item><title>EDDIE &amp; SHEENA present DIVINE TRASH</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/483</link><description>It's about time Newcastle had its own Wigstock, a big camp bad taste bash inspired by John Waters, the B52s and the Bride of Frankenstein.

Thankfully, those debauched harlots at Sounds of Seduction have invented Divine Trash, a celebration of cheap wigs, music and make up.

Not only will we be crowning MISS ALTERNATIVE NEWCASTLE, we'll be premiering DIVINE TRASH, a documentary that explores the early career of filmmaker John Waters, and his relationship with Divine.

The evening will also feature Britain's only transgender punk band, Women in Revolt. 

DJs THE MARK OF KANE and THE VILE MISS PEARS will provide bubblegum punk and garage rock and they promise to blow your wig off, especially as ENTRY IS FREE to trashy types who arrive in a wig before 9.00pm!</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/483</guid></item></channel></rss>
