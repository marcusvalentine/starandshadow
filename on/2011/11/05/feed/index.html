Or just fancy dancing with a silly wig on to beepy noises? Then Noise Karaoke is for you!

With your very own set, lights, synth back up and style consultant this is your chance to groan, wail and snarl like the hardcore vocalist you are (or not).

Wunderbar' closing night will be hosted by Action Hero in a suitably raucous fashion. Starting with Frontman - their half-cut version of a comeback gig. For a standing audience who like it loud. Followed by Noise Karaoke and late night DJs and dancing.

£9.50/£7.50 full programme including Frontman 
£7.50/£5.50 concessions for Noise Karaoke from 9pm onwards 
Advance karaoke booking online or in person on the night.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/437</guid></item></channel></rss>
