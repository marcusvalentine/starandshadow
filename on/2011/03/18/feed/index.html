THE SOUND ARTIST known as Z'EV beats, scrapes and manipulates large metal objects to create astonishing sonic phenomena. But don't call his work "experimental."

"I'm not a big fan of either experimental or noise music," said Z'EV. "A lot of experimental musicians feel it's totally OK to experiment onstage. As far as I'm concerned, you should experiment at home, but when an audience pays, you should deliver a result."
