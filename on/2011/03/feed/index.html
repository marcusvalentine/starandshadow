Minimal in style, maximal in impact.  </description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/703</guid></item><item><title>Jean Dielman 23 Quai de Commerce 1080 Brussels</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/702</link><description>At the core this film lies the performance of Delphine Seyrig (Last year in Marienbad), whose command of gesture and timing make this observation of bourgoise life a choreographed nightmare. A film that is awesome for the steel tipped certainty with which Chantal Akerman imbues her material.  </description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/702</guid></item><item><title>Les Rendez-vous D'Anna</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/704</link><description>An itinary of  hotel rooms, train stations interstitial spaces and  chance meetings during which the protagonist comes home to spend a night with her mother.

THE SOUND ARTIST known as Z'EV beats, scrapes and manipulates large metal objects to create astonishing sonic phenomena. But don't call his work "experimental."

"I'm not a big fan of either experimental or noise music," said Z'EV. "A lot of experimental musicians feel it's totally OK to experiment onstage. As far as I'm concerned, you should experiment at home, but when an audience pays, you should deliver a result."
