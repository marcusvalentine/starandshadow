Watch, as our anti-hero's tattooed knuckles take hold of an unsuspecting family whose widowed matriarch is initially hoodwinked by his preacher-man act. Behold, the charming charlatan's pursuit of the widow's fortune.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/699</guid></item><item><title>Lambs Gamble</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/gig/369</link><description>3 giant improv-heads shake down the traditional ‘rawk n roll’ power trio orchestration of drums (Fritz Welch), bass (George Cremaschi) and guitar (Eric Boros) and stretch them into awkward and unstable positions. Energetic and precise playing is then slathered in added electronic noodles leaving a clumped and clotted fog and unsightly stains all over your tablecloth. There’s heavy emphasis on organic percussive swipes, metallic texture and keening wails...The Cream they ain’t baby!</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/gig/369</guid></item><item><title>Conversation group</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/578</link><description>Every Tuesday, 4-6pm, informal conversation group to practice speaking English and to meet people. New learners with any or no experience of speaking English always welcome. Travel expenses can be covered for people who need it. New volunteers to support with practising English (and making tea!) always welcome. No experience necessary, volunteers can assist with answering questions, chatting and offering more individual support in smaller group activities. We try and make the sessions inclusive, welcoming and anti-discriminatory.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/578</guid></item><item><title>2011 Regional Forum for intercultural arts</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/550</link><description>NOT OPEN TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC - INTERCULTURAL ARTS ORGANISING - contact office@interculturalarts.co.uk for more info</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/550</guid></item><item><title>Programming Meeting</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/meeting/2</link><description>Programming Meeting</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/meeting/2</guid></item></channel></rss>
