Consensus is widely regarded as one of the most empowering ways of making decisions in a group. At best, it allows people to come together as equals and find creative win:win solutions that everyone is happy with. However, it's not always easy! 

The Star &amp; Shadow and Seeds for Change present 2 workshops on consesnsus decision making and facilitation.

Whatever experience of consensus you have had - good, bad, or non-existent, you are very welcome to come along and join in with these two workshops.
