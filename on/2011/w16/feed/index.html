Beginning with a childbirth, and the ensuing despair at the discovery that the baby is a girl, the film touches upon the myriad hardships endured by women living in Iran's male dominated world of bureaucracy, constant surveillance and age old inequalities.
But even in the midst of this stifling environment, the spirit, strength and courage of the circle of women cannot be extinguished.

Panahi's gripping and controversial film is further confirmation that Iranian cinema is now among the most original, vital and exciting in the world.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/767</guid></item><item><title>Fables - A Film Opera</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/770</link><description>Streetwise runs a weekly music workshop Programme in 11 homeless centres around the country.
