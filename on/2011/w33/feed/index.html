New learners with any or no experience of speaking English always welcome. Travel expenses can be covered for people who need it. 


New volunteers to support with practising English (and making tea!) always welcome. No experience necessary, volunteers can assist with answering questions, chatting and offering more individual support in smaller group activities. We try and make the sessions inclusive, welcoming and anti-discriminatory.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/540</guid></item><item><title>Benefit Gig</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/554</link><description>Anti Cuts Benefit for the HSBC 3</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/554</guid></item></channel></rss>
