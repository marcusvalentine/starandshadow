Stolen Children, Stolen Lives is the first of a two-part documentary by Gerry O’Sullivan on the arrests and abuses of Palestinian Children in the West Bank. 

Human Turbine follows the growing partnership between the threatened tent and cave dwelling Palestinian communities of the South Hebron Hills and Israeli activists who resist the continued occupation of the West Bank by Israel not through protests and demonstrations but through using their resources to help these communities survive and improve the quality of their lives against all odds.

Ehud Krinis, leading Israeli activist will lead the after film discussion.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/821</guid></item><item><title>weekender/the terror (boris karloff/jack nicholson) free</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/858</link><description></description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/858</guid></item><item><title>weekender/the terror of tiny town (billy curtis/little billy rhodes) free </title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/868</link><description></description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/868</guid></item><item><title>weekender/the hitch hiker (william talman) free</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/859</link><description></description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/859</guid></item><item><title>Weekender/Rock N Roll Revue (Duke Ellington/Nat King Cole) Free</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/860</link><description></description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/860</guid></item><item><title>weekender/rhythm and blues revue (count basie/bill bailey) free</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/861</link><description></description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/861</guid></item><item><title>weekender/rock rock rock (tuesday weld/chuck berry) free</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/862</link><description></description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/862</guid></item><item><title>weekender/meet john doe (gary cooper/barbara stanwyck) free</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/863</link><description></description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/863</guid></item><item><title>weekender/the last man on earth (vincent price) free</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/864</link><description></description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/864</guid></item><item><title>weekender/night of the living dead (duane jones) free</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/866</link><description></description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/866</guid></item><item><title>weekender/exploitation films (mash-up) free</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/867</link><description></description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/867</guid></item><item><title>Young Liar</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/gig/384</link><description>Fabulous night with the launch of the debut EP of the super great YOUNG LIAR + Support from Tide of Iron + Fab Rimini DJs until 4am!!</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/gig/384</guid></item><item><title>R.
