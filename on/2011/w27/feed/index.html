A small town overwhelmed by the smell of sewage desperately needs a new drainage ditch, but there are no public funds for such a project. When one villager realizes they do have funds for creating a fiction video, she drafts a screenplay for a horror film, hoping to use the film as a smoke screen for building a drainage ditch. Of course, making a film proves to be harder than the town expects.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/793</guid></item><item><title>Docs wi' the Heavies: Coal and Steel</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/795</link><description>An evening with the heavy industries.

Consensus is widely regarded as one of the most empowering ways of making decisions in a group. At best, it allows people to come together as equals and find creative win:win solutions that everyone is happy with. However, it's not always easy! 

The Star &amp; Shadow and Seeds for Change present 2 workshops on consesnsus decision making and facilitation.

Whatever experience of consensus you have had - good, bad, or non-existent, you are very welcome to come along and join in with these two workshops.
