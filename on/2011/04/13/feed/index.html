In this 2nd archive screening we explore the amazing ephemera that we could not make fit a theme. Commercials, Community and Amateur film and Television News sit side by side like siblings in a bathtub sharing a strain of humour, insight and the benefit of hindsight. These are unique artifacts you will almost certianly never have the opportunity to see again.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/757</guid></item></channel></rss>
