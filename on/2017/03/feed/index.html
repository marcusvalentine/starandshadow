The performance, taking place at the now derelict former Star and Shadow cinema, explores liminality and the real and perceived toxicity in our built and unbuilding environments. The live performance will be captured with three modified action cameras exploring the tension between the immediate and the cinematic. It will be streamed across three separate screens in Northern Charter – seen in conjunction with the venue’s panoramic windows, the viewer will be able to chart their own way through the installation/performance and shifting cityscape below.

The venue will open at 7 with the performance beginning at 7.30. A cash bar will be available before and after the performance.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/1935</guid></item></channel></rss>
