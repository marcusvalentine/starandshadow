The salvage collective brings together women, transgender and non-binary survivors and activists who experience gender oppression, violence and abuse in activist communities. We aim to provide a network to share experiences, resources, skills and build communities of belief, support and action.

We recently launched a report-zine and toolkit to help develop knowledge and understanding about gendered violence in activist communities.

We are very happy to facilitate a series of free one-day workshops funded by the Feminist Review Trust across the UK:

The workshops start at 10am and finish at 5:30pm at the latest. Food and refreshments will be provided. Activists of all genders are welcome.

Places are on a first come first served basis however if the workshops are over-subscribed priority will be given to activists with disciplinary, complaints, safer spaces, accountability and policy responsibilities.

For more information and to register for a place.
