La Bete tells the story of a poor family, pleased when the daughter of a wealthy man agrees to marry their son. A striking and usual take on both beauty and the beast, and liberation of inner desires. La Bete displays imagination and an erotic insight into Borowczyk's style.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/69</guid></item></channel></rss>
