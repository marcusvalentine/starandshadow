Based on a true story about a family from Yorkshire who defect to East Germany for a life of Marxist utopia behind the Iron Curtain..?

The first screening of Mrs Ratcliffe's Revolution will be at 3pm, followed by a Q&amp;A with two stars of the film - Brittany Ashworth (Alex Ratcliffe) and Nigel Betts (Uncle Philip).

And if you can't make that screening, we will be showing it again at 7.30pm as part of a more social affair!  Come along, hang out, join in and have fun!
