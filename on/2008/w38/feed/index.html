The ultimate in our Woody-Allen-Made-a-Stinker season.  Matchpoint is Woody’s favourite film (of his own) – but then apparently he doesn’t watch his films once they’re released so how would he know. (These facts are from IMDB.com so they must be true!)  Perhaps it’s a bit cruel to show it with a live commentary from hosts of the Bad Film Club. Let’s hope he has a sense of humour.
