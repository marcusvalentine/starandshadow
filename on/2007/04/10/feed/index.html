Atelier MTK - France's most awesome DIY film lab - are presenting their newest work, LEVOX. It's an improvisation playing with all the possibilities of live multi-projection, sound and images. From 16mm sound and visual found footage, images are shot, processed, printed, colored and 'special effected' in their handcraft laboratory. A visceral visual poetry, one that may borrow from the normal cinema, but can never be given back.
