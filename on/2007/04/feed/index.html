Community care and the closing down of the old asylums brought a whole way of life to an end, and few now remember what it was like for those who passed through the asylum doors as patients. This short film allows people who spent much of their lives in the old asylums to talk about their lives from admission to discharge, including institutional life, treatments, resistance and relationships.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/35</guid></item><item><title>The Big Sleep</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/58</link><description>Spend the evening with a Bogie &amp; Bacall double bill!</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/58</guid></item><item><title>To Have and Have Not</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/62</link><description>"At last!

Theoretical Girl is the brainchild of Amy, who writes and performs all her songs herself, sometimes with a backing track, and sometimes with the aid of her mates The Equations. NME have called her a "goth-pop genius" and "stone cold brilliant", while Starvox said her live performance is a "fine demonstration of how a solo performer can command a stage without any histrionics or grandstanding."

Mit are from Cologne and are absolutely bonkers. Their singer looks about 11, but has the stage presence of about three people, and they make electro indie-punk that makes Klaxons sound like easy listening. We first saw them in Berlin where they played with NME favourites Shitdisco and brought the house down. </description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/gig/49</guid></item><item><title>THE ROAD TO RIMINI PASQUA SPECIALE</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/gig/43</link><description>Entry - £5/£6 (non members) - tickets available from Alt.Vinyl and Star and Shadow Box Office - strictly over 18s only!!!

Atelier MTK - France's most awesome DIY film lab - are presenting their newest work, LEVOX. It's an improvisation playing with all the possibilities of live multi-projection, sound and images. From 16mm sound and visual found footage, images are shot, processed, printed, colored and 'special effected' in their handcraft laboratory. A visceral visual poetry, one that may borrow from the normal cinema, but can never be given back.

Weekender 2007 Launch - Acteal: A Massacre Foretold</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/festival/9</link><description>What does it feel like to know that you are about to be killed? Nearly a decade ago, a terrified village in southern Mexico sought refuge in a small wooden church and awaited their inevitable fate. Until now the full story of the massacre at Acteal has never been told. "Acteal: A Massacre Foretold" is by Nick Higgins, a filmmaker and academic and is the current director of the Cultural Studies programme at Edinburgh University.
