Theoretical Girl is the brainchild of Amy, who writes and performs all her songs herself, sometimes with a backing track, and sometimes with the aid of her mates The Equations. NME have called her a "goth-pop genius" and "stone cold brilliant", while Starvox said her live performance is a "fine demonstration of how a solo performer can command a stage without any histrionics or grandstanding."

Mit are from Cologne and are absolutely bonkers. Their singer looks about 11, but has the stage presence of about three people, and they make electro indie-punk that makes Klaxons sound like easy listening. We first saw them in Berlin where they played with NME favourites Shitdisco and brought the house down. </description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/gig/49</guid></item><item><title>General Meeting</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/meeting/226</link><description>General Meeting</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/meeting/226</guid></item></channel></rss>
