They can of course vocalise their feelings because we run a participatory cinema, so heckling and shouts of approval are encouraged. If your film will slice across the audiences eyes like Un Chien Andalou, or make eyes close through boredom or lack of endurance, we the anti-seletors donmt care, because as long as the film is shorter than 15mins we'll take it. On this first EWO at the Star and Shadow, watch out for opportunities to win FREE super 8 and 16mm film and processing. We encourage movie-maker's hollywood attempts and avant-garde ramblings, commonly known as Artist's Film and Video. (£3, free for film makers)</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/278</guid></item><item><title>The Old Maid</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/274</link><description>A ‘soapy’ piece of melodrama full of sacrifice, deception and emotion. Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins star in this weepy “irresistable tosh”. The original play, based on an Edith Wharton novel, won the Pulitzer Prize.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/274</guid></item><item><title>I Vitelloni</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/252</link><description>The grandfather of 'slacker' movies,(rough trans. 'The Guys') I Vitelloni (rough trans. 'The Guys') look at their elders, see the sterile results of lives rendered bereft by tradition and "sacrifice", and naturally rebel, searching in easy hedonism for the happiness that has eluded their parents. Fellini's semi-autobiographical, second feature, shares many of the neo-realist traits of his peers, but plays tricks with them too. A bit of a forgotten masterpiece.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/252</guid></item></channel></rss>
