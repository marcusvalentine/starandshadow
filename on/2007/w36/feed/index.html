It captures the essence and humanity of the enigmatic mental health worker and the extraordinary creative community around him.

Leonarder is the man behind the Mu-Mesons, the influential noise band loved by Richard Kern, Thurston Moore (Sonic Youth), and Mike Patton (Fantomas, Faith No More, Mr Bungle) all of whom appear in the film. Comprised of manic depressives and schizophrenics, the band was inspired by Leonarder's early career working as a diversional therapist with the mentally ill and his love of underground music culture and performance.

This film is a must for fans of outsider music and art, and if you loved The Cramps Live at Napa State Mental Hospital, you will love Jaimie.
