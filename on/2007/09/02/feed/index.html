No Borders Camp UK 2007</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/116</link><description>A week-long camp is being held at Gatwick Airport from 19th to 24th September. Sparked by the imminent opening of a new immigration detention centre (prison) near Gatwick, the No Borders Camp will be a place where we can come together to learn, take action, and to challenge the visible and invisible borders that divide people.
Films Without Borders invites you to an evening of films, bands, and feasting on ideas! Come and join us.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/116</guid></item><item><title>No Borders gig</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/gig/32</link><description>Helictite and others</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/gig/32</guid></item></channel></rss>
