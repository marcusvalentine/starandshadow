'The Guys') I Vitelloni (rough trans. 'The Guys') look at their elders, see the sterile results of lives rendered bereft by tradition and "sacrifice", and naturally rebel, searching in easy hedonism for the happiness that has eluded their parents. Fellini's semi-autobiographical, second feature, shares many of the neo-realist traits of his peers, but plays tricks with them too. A bit of a forgotten masterpiece.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/222</guid></item></channel></rss>
