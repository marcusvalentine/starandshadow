They can of course vocalise their feelings because we run a participatory cinema, so heckling and shouts of approval are encouraged. If your film will slice across the audiences eyes like Un Chien Andalou, or make eyes close through boredom or lack of endurance, we the anti-seletors donmt care, because as long as the film is shorter than 15mins we'll take it. On this first EWO at the Star and Shadow, watch out for opportunities to win FREE super 8 and 16mm film and processing. We encourage movie-maker's hollywood attempts and avant-garde ramblings, commonly known as Artist's Film and Video. (Â£3, free for film makers)</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/278</guid></item></channel></rss>
