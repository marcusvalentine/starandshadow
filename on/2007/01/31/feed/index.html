Powerful encounters with artists, filmmakers, orphans and taxi drivers reveal an existence of occupation and resistance with bleak honesty. 

‘All artists, in Iraq or in the world, don’t care about anything….they are just looking for beauty in this world…and truth’ Hayder Mousa Daffar

This will be followed by the 2003 interview by former Labour Cabinet Minister Tony Benn with former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in Baghdad. This historic piece of footage shows the leading figure of British opposition to the war in Iraq discussing the possibilities, the necessities and and motives for peace with Saddam Hussein.  
 
 ‘If we look at the representatives of two super powers - America and Britain - and look at their conduct and their language, we would notice that they are more motivated by war than their responsibility for peace. And when they talk about peace all they do is accuse others they wish to destroy in the name of peace.’ Saddam Hussein
