Those dopes at the US military forgot about their secret weapon experiment, you guessed it, mutant piranhas. As if piranhas weren’t terrifying enough in the first place… Anyway, after an unfortunate swimming experience where it turns out they’re not as accommodating as dolphins, the discovered teeth with fish attached, set out on a meat feast, will the children’s summer camp be saved?! Some how I don’t think so.. 
Plus after the film… disco terror at Piranha-rama till 1am
