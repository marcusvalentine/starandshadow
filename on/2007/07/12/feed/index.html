Once a small local affair, it now pulls crowds of over 200,000. The Director Milivoj Ilic's account of the place, the people and the competitors in 2005 is as exuberant, joyous and noisy as the festival itself.  Milvoivoj Ilic will be at the screening to talk about the film afterwards.  Showing as part of BRASS - Durham International Festival. </description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/43</guid></item></channel></rss>
