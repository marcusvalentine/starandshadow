The Cube's Kayle Brandon and Kate Rich present a realtime, DIY workshop on how to make Cube-Cola from raw materials, using an open source recipe and techniques siphoned from the worlds of laboratory science and cake-making. No food technology expertise required. Test tubes, hammer drill and kitchen whisks will be provided.



Cube-Cola Soiree. 6pm.
The fruits of the day's labour will be sampled in an apr√®s-lab openhouse, the Star and Shadow bar, where we will blind-taste Cube-Cola with a number of major market competitors.
All welcome, bring your own cocktail umbrellas!
