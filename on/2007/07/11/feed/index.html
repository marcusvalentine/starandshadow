This movie tells of nature as life itself.  Set in a timeless Aboriginal land, culture and landscape , we are lead through a beguiling story…
“And there's plenty happens in this story...there's a stranger comes and one of them wives goes missin' and there's a man with a belly big as a mountain. There's sorcery and magic too, and a wrong spear in the wrong body, and more spears and bad spirits. And even that's not everything that's happening in this story.”
