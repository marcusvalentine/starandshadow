We are proud to present the artistic work of young Polish directors from the Wajda School (www.wajdaschool.pl), animated short films by Tomasz Baginski (‘The Cathedral’- nominated for an Oscar in 2003) and film "Symmetry" by Konrad Niewolski. In addition to the films there will be photography workshops and a photography exhibition ‘Poles and the church’ (displayed for the first time). All are welcome. More details to come!
