Community care and the closing down of the old asylums brought a whole way of life to an end, and few now remember what it was like for those who passed through the asylum doors as patients. This short film allows people who spent much of their lives in the old asylums to talk about their lives from admission to discharge, including institutional life, treatments, resistance and relationships.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/35</guid></item><item><title>The Big Sleep</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/58</link><description>Spend the evening with a Bogie &amp; Bacall double bill!</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/58</guid></item><item><title>To Have and Have Not</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/62</link><description>"At last!

Atelier MTK - France's most awesome DIY film lab - are presenting their newest work, LEVOX. It's an improvisation playing with all the possibilities of live multi-projection, sound and images. From 16mm sound and visual found footage, images are shot, processed, printed, colored and 'special effected' in their handcraft laboratory. A visceral visual poetry, one that may borrow from the normal cinema, but can never be given back.

Weekender 2007 Launch - Acteal: A Massacre Foretold</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/festival/9</link><description>What does it feel like to know that you are about to be killed? Nearly a decade ago, a terrified village in southern Mexico sought refuge in a small wooden church and awaited their inevitable fate. Until now the full story of the massacre at Acteal has never been told. "Acteal: A Massacre Foretold" is by Nick Higgins, a filmmaker and academic and is the current director of the Cultural Studies programme at Edinburgh University.

No? Yes? Then send your submission in to this open-call film and video night. It just so happens we have a never-before-seen amateur film masterpiece we found in Berlin on super 8 which will honestly make you think about 'how many great filmmakers denied us their work by quitting and becoming teachers or whatever...'
