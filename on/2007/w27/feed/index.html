“And there's plenty happens in this story...there's a stranger comes and one of them wives goes missin' and there's a man with a belly big as a mountain. There's sorcery and magic too, and a wrong spear in the wrong body, and more spears and bad spirits. And even that's not everything that's happening in this story.”

Once a small local affair, it now pulls crowds of over 200,000. The Director Milivoj Ilic's account of the place, the people and the competitors in 2005 is as exuberant, joyous and noisy as the festival itself.  Milvoivoj Ilic will be at the screening to talk about the film afterwards.  Showing as part of BRASS - Durham International Festival. </description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/43</guid></item><item><title>10 Canoes</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/59</link><description>Film-making like this is a rare experience.

He is a Czech surrealist animator, famous for bringing Alice and the Jaberwocky to life through Stop Motion, but rarely do we get to see his superb shorts on the cinema screen.  Tonight, as part of Catriona Maddock's art preview, we show 5 of them including Ossuary and Food.

Catriona Maddocks show in the bar delves into surreal anthropomorphic transformation through some weird genetically modified furniture.

The Cube's Kayle Brandon and Kate Rich present a realtime, DIY workshop on how to make Cube-Cola from raw materials, using an open source recipe and techniques siphoned from the worlds of laboratory science and cake-making. No food technology expertise required. Test tubes, hammer drill and kitchen whisks will be provided.



Cube-Cola Soiree. 6pm.
The fruits of the day's labour will be sampled in an après-lab openhouse, the Star and Shadow bar, where we will blind-taste Cube-Cola with a number of major market competitors.
All welcome, bring your own cocktail umbrellas!
