Bogart makes love to his kind of woman!" This is where Bogie and Bacall first started, in Bacall's debut film based on Ernest Hemingway's novel – what a picture! With the Second World War, the Resistance and steamy relationships, can anyone remain neutral?</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/47</guid></item><item><title>The Pervert's Guide to Cinema</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/190</link><description>The Pervert's Guide To Cinema takes the viewer on an exhilarating ride through some of the greatest movies ever made.

Theoretical Girl is the brainchild of Amy, who writes and performs all her songs herself, sometimes with a backing track, and sometimes with the aid of her mates The Equations. NME have called her a "goth-pop genius" and "stone cold brilliant", while Starvox said her live performance is a "fine demonstration of how a solo performer can command a stage without any histrionics or grandstanding."

Mit are from Cologne and are absolutely bonkers. Their singer looks about 11, but has the stage presence of about three people, and they make electro indie-punk that makes Klaxons sound like easy listening. We first saw them in Berlin where they played with NME favourites Shitdisco and brought the house down. </description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/gig/49</guid></item><item><title>THE ROAD TO RIMINI PASQUA SPECIALE</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/gig/43</link><description>Entry - £5/£6 (non members) - tickets available from Alt.Vinyl and Star and Shadow Box Office - strictly over 18s only!!!
