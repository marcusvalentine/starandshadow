The group existed from 1980 – 1987 and produced avant garde music, film and performance projects including exhibiting at documenta 8, Kassel. Their radical Dadaist character embodied the city’s unstable identity and their acclaimed Super-8 films, including The Life of Sid Vicious and Berliner Kitchen Music evoke a disappearing era.
