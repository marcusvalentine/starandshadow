from the New York Underground Film Festival on Thursday 15, Saturday 17 and Sunday 18 November 2007.  

We’ve selected some of the best films from this year’s New York Underground Film Festival and brought them to the Star and Shadow - the UK’s seismic epi-centre for all that’s happening in film - experimental - political  -  indi  - and put together a weekend festival – New York music – food – and Manhattan booze – cocktails - everything at our  usual low slung prices.
