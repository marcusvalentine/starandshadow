This and other questions are posed openly in this film exposing the consequences of the commandment “Be fruitful and multiply” for religious Jewish women.
The film offers a sensitive insight into the lives of women in ultra-orthodox society as it follows the stories of four women in Jerusalem and Brooklyn.  Yentel is the key figure who turns from an obedient wife, internalising the strict social code of her society, into an independent woman who rebels against the traditional patriarchal society in which she lives.
