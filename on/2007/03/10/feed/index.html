Something tells us they're in for a good year. In support we have Last Of The Real Hardmen, the solo forays of Chris Summerlin (from Nottingham's magnificent Lords). 2006 saw Chris release his '10,000 Miles' album to much acclaim, and he's since added Patrick Farmer (The Good Anna, Designer Babies) on drums - expect spaced-out primitive guitar journeys and strung-out waster blues.
