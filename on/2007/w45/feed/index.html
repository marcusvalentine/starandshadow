We’ve selected some of the best films from this year’s New York Underground Film Festival and brought them to the Star and Shadow - the UK’s seismic epi-centre for all that’s happening in film - experimental - political  -  indi  - and put together a weekend festival – New York music – food – and Manhattan booze – cocktails - everything at our  usual low slung prices.
