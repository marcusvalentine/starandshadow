In the summer 2006, the hottest year ever recorded in recent history, 600 people convinced that there was no time to waste set up a camp for climate action outside of the Drax coal-fired power station in Yorkshire. It became a space of collective learning, sustainable living and taking direct action on the root causes of climate change. 
After the film we can discuss the action planned for summer 2007. We have less than 10 years to radically reduce our carbon emissions to avoid catastrophic climate change. The time to act is now. This summer, be part of it. Get involved!

This movie tells of nature as life itself.  Set in a timeless Aboriginal land, culture and landscape , we are lead through a beguiling story…
“And there's plenty happens in this story...there's a stranger comes and one of them wives goes missin' and there's a man with a belly big as a mountain. There's sorcery and magic too, and a wrong spear in the wrong body, and more spears and bad spirits. And even that's not everything that's happening in this story.”
