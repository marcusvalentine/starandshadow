This is the latest extension of Andrew Hodson’s (map music, warm digits and Arable records) music output. After releasing their critically acclaimed debut album in 2006, they have been away recording their new song-based album which they are going to be performing on this night. So expect mariachi trumpets, rolling drums, silky strings and sweet soulful singing.
