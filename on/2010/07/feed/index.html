is about 17 men named Frank who make their way through Helsinki in a
commandeered subway car.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/678</guid></item><item><title>Crime and Punishment (Rikos ja Rangaistus)</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/592</link><description>Dostoyevsky goes rock'n roll! Aki Kaurismäki - the Finnish Auteur season opens ambitiously with an adaptation of this literary classic, which Hitchcock himself claimed be too difficult for big screen. 'I'll show you boy' was Kaurismäki's answer to this challenge. What a debut feature!</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/592</guid></item><item><title>Ariel</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/630</link><description>Everything Kaurismäki had stylistically worked for so far. Ariel is full of minimalistic, dark deadpan humour, subtle details, visual storytelling and possibly the greatest and bleakest death sequence ever! Man's search for new life is playfully underlined by the bizarre events and stylish soundtrack. Ariel is part the 'working class' trilogy. </description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/630</guid></item><item><title>Favela on Blast </title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/606</link><description>¡VAMOS! Festival &amp; ¡Cantina Latina! present: Favela on Blast

This documentary, produced by Diplo, looks at ‘Baile Funk’, an energetic, underground music from the favelas of Rio de Janeiro. It mixes bombastic rhythms with powerful rap vocals in Brazilian slang which talk about life in Rio’s favelas; sex, love, poverty, violence, pride and aspirations, giving this once marginalized community a voice.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/606</guid></item><item><title>Leningrad Cowboys Go America</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/631</link><description>Absurdist deadpan road comedy into the heart of rock and roll. So laid back and so cool that to laugh out loud at it would seem hopelessly square. Stunning cinematography and amazing soundtrack; from Steppenwolf to polka, follows the band's struggle in the grubby, run down reality of the American dream.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/631</guid></item><item><title>I Hired A Contract Killer</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/632</link><description>A Frenchman in London (played by Truffaut fave Jean-Pierre Léaud), is laid-off from his job after fifteen years. He tries to commit suicide by hiring a hitman, but then falls in love, and has to find a way of getting the assassin to call off the job. Watch out for the late, great, Joe Strummer.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/632</guid></item><item><title>La Vie de Bohème</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/633</link><description>An impoverished poet, a painter from Albania and an Irish composer, all down on their luck, meet in Paris, and struggle to survive by sharing whatever little money they have in order to maintain a certain, although basic and simple, standard of living. When the painter (Matti Pellonpaa) falls in love, their lives change forever.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/633</guid></item><item><title>XXY</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/618</link><description>Alex, a 15-year old intersex person from Buenos Aires lives secluded with her parents in a fishing village in Uruguay.  Her parents have settled down in Uruguay in order to live a quiet life until one day her mother invites a couple and their 15-year old son for the week-end.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/618</guid></item><item><title>STONEWALL </title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/619</link><description>Who could have guessed that a bunch of men in dresses would breath life into the movement to win equal rights for gay men and lesbians? Certainly not the police who raided the Stonewall Inn, a popular "drag" bar in Greenwich Village. After a long history of police raids, extortion, and brutality, a gaggle of drag queens at the Stonewall decided they'd had enough and begun to riot when the police try to load them into a paddy wagon.

Unfortunately, nothing worked out quite as it was supposed to - years later, Hedwig is leading her rock band on a tour of the U.S., telling her life story through a series of concerts at Bilgewater Inn seafood restaurants. Her tour dates coincide with those of arena-rock star Tommy Gnosis, a wide-eyed boy who once loved Hedwig... but then left with all her songs</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/687</guid></item><item><title>Tears of Kongo  </title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/642</link><description>Documentary film captures the ongoing civil war in the Democratic Republic of Kongo.

This ambitious documentary evokes the scale and difficulties of radical social change in a political and poetic collage. Come and judge for yourself whether it succeeds in the task.

The film-makers will also be present at the screening and will take part in a Q&amp;A afterwards, so don't miss out on a good chance to find out more about the film directly from them, or take them to task if you're not convinced.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/637</guid></item><item><title>Breathless</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/646</link><description>Winner of over 13 much lauded awards at international film festivals including 2009 in Rotterdam.

Yang Ik-june's gruesome and harsh directorial debut tells the story a lowlife debt collector exercising thuggish ways to collect his money. The recipient of nothing but anger since his childhood, he expresses himself through violence.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/646</guid></item><item><title>MEXICAN WRESTLING NIGHT</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/gig/203</link><description>Masked Mexican wrestlers are set to invade Newcastle’s Star and Shadow Cinema on Friday 9 July from 7.30pm in an evening featuring live wrestlers, bands and films as part of ¡VAMOS!

Loved by Kurt Cobain, and described as "the indiest band ever", the Cannanes have recently had a Converse sneaker designed in their honour. </description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/gig/226</guid></item><item><title>SDF present: The Manly Art</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/gig/270</link><description> Despite the confusing name, this event will involve surprisingly little bare-knuckle fighting (fingers crossed), and should not be confused with the Mxican wrestling night (also at S&amp;S with actual wrestling). It should involve some shiny hot PostFutureRetrospective AvantDisco or something like that... WHO WE GOT??? WE GOT...</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/gig/270</guid></item><item><title>Narc Fest</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/gig/202</link><description>APOLOGIES - THIS EVENT HAS BEEN CANCELLED
An evening of Berlin and Detroit drenched excursions into the purest electronic and minimal techno sounds, featuring some extremely special guest performers and DJ’s to the backdrop of a uniquely commissioned visual art piece.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/gig/202</guid></item><item><title>Ecstatic Sunshine</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/gig/243</link><description>Throughout the years the essence of Ecstatic Sunshine has been located within unique guitar work, however the shifting cast has allowed Ecstatics to spread it’s reach effortlessly into echoes of punk, ambient, Krautrock, reggae and techno.

Recommended for fans of Harmonia.
