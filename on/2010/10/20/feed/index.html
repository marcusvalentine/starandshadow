Unique in that it is created by the participants, not the organisers, and in that sense it has survived its original ideals/utopias, but the ideas have been eroded by time, pressure from the larger society. Th film questions our ability to stand behind those ideals over a lifetime. 

The DIRECTOR will be in available for teleconference Q&amp;A after the movie.
