We’ll be joined by THE BACCHAE – psychedelic San Francisco inspired garage rockers from Leeds, feral jungle beat from RUSSELL &amp; THE WOLVES, and we’ll be showing go-go B-movie classic BLAST OFF GIRLS (1967).

All this, plus support from Senor Beatnik and tunes from DJ Michael Clunkie Vinyl Junkie. Dress to excess and be prepare to be trashy!
