While Chris T-T is too young (and swears too much) to be an old school folk hero he is travelling the right path, with powerful unique songwriting, an uncompromising outlook and flashes of sardonic humour. "A folk wonder! Funny wise and builds to a clistering climax" (NME). 
Supporting Chris will be the wonderful John Egdell. A night not to be missed. 

Tickets Â£6 on the door. Plus free cakes. What is not to love?
