This will be at the new time of 12noon - 5pm in our homeland the Star and Shadow Cinema.
We’ll have 20 stalls of goodies for you to feast your eyes on from some of the best creative local talent  as well as a host of vintage and 2nd hand traders offering you some retro bargains. Heres a sneaky peek at some of the sellers we’ll have this time round:
*Black Flame books will be in residence with a huge variety of 2nd hand literature for all you book worms out there.
*Pinnies for Hinnies will be offering their handmade retro chic aprons for the domestic goddess in your life.
*Dolls and Molls offering their super-cute kitsch accesories and jewellery. * Artist Emma McClaughlin offering her beautiful original artwork.
*Alan Edge will be bringing his great taste in music in the form of all things vinyl.
* Louise Bradley will be setting up shop with her enormous array of uber-cool retro and vintage homeware

As well as the usual fab stalls we’ll also be bringing some nibbley snacky things to get you in the party mood and Phil Tyler and friends will be giving us a little tune as well as some music from another local musician.
Everyone is welcome and its free entry as usual.

Thanks for all your support over these last 2 years we couldn’t have got here without you. Please tell your friends and family to join the party.
