Pakistan and  Afghanistan.  It tells of a boy, resistant to picking up his father's 
trade of gun-making as he challenges the expectations of those around him.  
Made secretly and with non-professsionals this is rough, gorgeous cinema
that speaks from the heart.

Come and see this ever-favourite Hollywood musical.  Every song is a classic that you will want to belt out, or whistle, or hum, or mime while you watch the story of love, fun and song unfold on screen.
