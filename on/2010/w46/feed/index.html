to aid the local resitance against the German occupying forces.
Made for the most part in newly liberated 
France during the war, this production from
the RAF used real Special Operations
Executive personnel, locations and aircrew to recreate 
the scenes in the film.

Best described as a silent musical: no dialogue is heard at all throughout the film, but music from unsigned Uruguay rock/metal/psychedelic bands make the film fly. 24 hours in the life of a singer with autistic tendencies.

Between documentary and fiction, this little gem has won prestigious prizes, among which the highest prize (tiger award) at the Rotterdam Film Festival. </description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/627</guid></item><item><title>Johnny Handle &amp; Chris Hedley: Songs of Pit and Coast</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/gig/269</link><description>Johnny and Chrisâ€™ first show at the Star &amp; Shadow, brings an attitude and freshness to old work songs, traditional ballads as well as firing up Johnny's own material. A legend in many of our lifetimes, and a timely reminder of the bleak past (and possible) future of the North East working class experience.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/gig/269</guid></item><item><title>Road to Rimini feat.
