She has won prizes at some of the most prestigious festivals, and we are very proud to be showing her latest film. A “brilliant, maddeningly enigmatic puzzle of a movie” (The New York Times), about a woman confronted with guilt, and the history of Argentina.

to aid the local resitance against the German occupying forces.
Made for the most part in newly liberated 
France during the war, this production from
the RAF used real Special Operations
Executive personnel, locations and aircrew to recreate 
the scenes in the film.

Best described as a silent musical: no dialogue is heard at all throughout the film, but music from unsigned Uruguay rock/metal/psychedelic bands make the film fly. 24 hours in the life of a singer with autistic tendencies.

Between documentary and fiction, this little gem has won prestigious prizes, among which the highest prize (tiger award) at the Rotterdam Film Festival. </description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/627</guid></item><item><title>The Dog Pound (La Perrera, Uruguay)</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/628</link><description>Winner of the Best Film Award at the Rotterdam Film Festival, and elected Best Uruguayan Film of 2006 by the country’s Association of Film Critics, this is a slow and contemplative film about David, a 25-year-old who loves smoking pot, and has a heroic capacity for doing nothing. Tragicomedy of a slacker, shot on 16mm.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/628</guid></item><item><title>Whisky (Uruguay)</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/584</link><description>Multi-awarded at some of the most prestigious international film festivals (Cannes, Tokyo, Chicago, Peru, Spain, etc), this is a very subtle film about human communication, or the impossibility of it. The owner of a sock factory asks one of his employees to act as his wife during the visit of his brother.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/584</guid></item><item><title>Dieter Moebius (Cluster)</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/gig/293</link><description>Dieter Moebius is a Krautrock and electronic pioneer.

It had been there since 1930, and generations of cinema goers thrilled to live music, both before, during and after the main feature. Today that cinema is the Carling Academy.

And today, for the first time in over fifty years, a Newcastle cinema unveils a cinema organ, as the Star &amp; Shadow launches its restored Compton organ.
