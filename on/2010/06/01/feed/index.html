Ora Cogan sings a kind of music the could almost be termed Gothic Country, were it not for the unexpected turns that her chord progressions take just when you think it’s about to reach some easy-on-the-ear culmination. Her sound is dark, dreamy, mysterious, slow, the Country drawl found in the music rather than the accent, and the reverb provides the engulfing echo that holds all those qualities together, turning them into something an opaque atmosphere that smothers the vocals, which sound as more like a faint wail heard unintentionally behind a cloud of floating sound.
