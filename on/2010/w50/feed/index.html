We are doing this through producing a bi-monthly newsreel, made up of a number of videos short enough to use in union and campaign meetings. Reel News is completely independent and non-aligned. We are completely against sectarianism in all its forms, anti-capitalist in outlook, against the anti-trade union laws and in favour of mass collective action in the workplace and on the streets to change society.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/735</guid></item><item><title>Jane Arden Season: Vibration &amp; Anti-Clock</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/708</link><description>Vibration is "an exercise in meditation utilising experimental film and video techniques"
Geoff Brown &amp; Robert Murphy

“A complex and fascinating experimental exploration of time and identity.
Anti-Clock is a film of authentic, startling originality. Filled with high tension
and high intelligence, Anti-Clock is mysterious, disturbing, fascinating and
exciting.” (Jack Kroll, Newsweek)
