All welcome - bring a page of your favourite novel/going for growth report/trashy celeb magazine, cut out the words and mix them up with ones from star &amp; shadow programmes.

Bring a bite to eat. Raunchy words welcome.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/177</guid></item></channel></rss>
