We are always looking for people to work with us to share the work.
This is also the time for a general fix up and sort out of the building.  If you have the time and skills, or even if you don't, come along and help make the cinema an even greater place.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/96</guid></item></channel></rss>
