We're screening one of his films tonight as part of an international campaign to show our support, with cinemas around the world screening his films this week.

We're screening The Circle (Dayereh) which won 11 awards internationally including the prestigious Golden Lion in Venice:

Set over the course of a single day, Jafar Panahi's powerful film is an ensemble piece that tells the stark tales of several young Iranian women and the harsh society in which they live.
Beginning with a childbirth, and the ensuing despair at the discovery that the baby is a girl, the film touches upon the myriad hardships endured by women living in Iran's male dominated world of bureaucracy, constant surveillance and age old inequalities.
But even in the midst of this stifling environment, the spirit, strength and courage of the circle of women cannot be extinguished.

Panahi's gripping and controversial film is further confirmation that Iranian cinema is now among the most original, vital and exciting in the world.
