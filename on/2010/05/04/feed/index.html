Both the kids and parents will be getting dressed up as their favourite star wars characters. There will be face paints, star wars themed games - monopoly, chess, battleships. Participants will bring food to share and of course we'll watch a Star Wars film. This is a private party, so the doors won't be open to the public. If you want to get on the invite list or contribute please contact Wilf 07906439084 or wilf.abundantearth@virgin.net</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/89</guid></item><item><title>Other Meeting</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/meeting/40</link><description>Other Meeting</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/meeting/40</guid></item><item><title>Other Meeting</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/meeting/39</link><description>Other Meeting</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/meeting/39</guid></item></channel></rss>
