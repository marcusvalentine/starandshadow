The degree of freedom to artistic expression is extra-ordinary, especially if replaced into the context of the political environment prevailing in Bulgaria in the 70s. The absence of dialogue and music, together with Black and White cinematography emphasize the dramatic content of the movie. The direction is remarkable, and the play is first-class. Definitely, the best Bulgarian movie, and a must-see for every cinephile. </description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/732</guid></item><item><title>New Volunteer Induction</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/250</link><description>Come along and find out more about your favourite DIY cinema, and how you can get involved!</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/250</guid></item></channel></rss>
