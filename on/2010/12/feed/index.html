The degree of freedom to artistic expression is extra-ordinary, especially if replaced into the context of the political environment prevailing in Bulgaria in the 70s. The absence of dialogue and music, together with Black and White cinematography emphasize the dramatic content of the movie. The direction is remarkable, and the play is first-class. Definitely, the best Bulgarian movie, and a must-see for every cinephile. </description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/732</guid></item><item><title>Jane Arden Season: Separation</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/706</link><description>Scripted by and starring Jane Arden, Separation portrays the fragile complexity of its protagonist during a marital breakdown, through fragmented scenes, experimental, fragmented sequences. Set against the backdrop of 'swinging' 60s London. The soundtrack is by Procul Harum and light shows by artist Mark Boyle.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/706</guid></item><item><title>Top Hat</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/733</link><description>For the last Decades of Musicals film we are throwing chronology to the wind and going back to the 1930s where, let's be honest, all the best musicals live. Astaire and Rogers partner up again and croon such classics as 'Cheek to Cheek' and, of course, 'Top Hat...'.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/733</guid></item><item><title>Jane Arden Season: The Other Side of the Underneath</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/707</link><description>Jane Arden's violent and powerful film is an exploration into the mind of a woman labelled schizophrenic, whilst challenging the taboos of society. It is the only British feature film of the 1970s with a solo female direction credit and features a powerful soundtrack led by cellist Sally Pullinger.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/707</guid></item><item><title>Reel News / Cutting Edge</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/735</link><description>REEL NEWS is an activist video collective, set up to publicise and share information on inspirational campaigns and struggles - not just in this country, but across the world. We are doing this through producing a bi-monthly newsreel, made up of a number of videos short enough to use in union and campaign meetings. Reel News is completely independent and non-aligned. We are completely against sectarianism in all its forms, anti-capitalist in outlook, against the anti-trade union laws and in favour of mass collective action in the workplace and on the streets to change society.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/735</guid></item><item><title>Jane Arden Season: Vibration &amp; Anti-Clock</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/708</link><description>Vibration is "an exercise in meditation utilising experimental film and video techniques"
Geoff Brown &amp; Robert Murphy

“A complex and fascinating experimental exploration of time and identity.
Anti-Clock is a film of authentic, startling originality. Filled with high tension
and high intelligence, Anti-Clock is mysterious, disturbing, fascinating and
exciting.” (Jack Kroll, Newsweek)
