Unique in that it is created by the participants, not the organisers, and in that sense it has survived its original ideals/utopias, but the ideas have been eroded by time, pressure from the larger society. Th film questions our ability to stand behind those ideals over a lifetime. 

The DIRECTOR will be in available for teleconference Q&amp;A after the movie.

As fast and extreme, as they are interesting and trippy, they have gained a reputation for putting on the most intense gigs you’re likely to see.   </description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/gig/274</guid></item><item><title>Cave</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/gig/277</link><description>A night of proper psyched-out, motorik energy.
