Enrico Cocozza (1921–1997), was a Scottish filmmaker who won many film awards during the 1940s and 1950s. His often surreal films were mainly filmed in and around the town of Wishaw in Scotland, where his family owned the popular Belhaven Cafe. These include Chic's Day (1950), a prize winner at the 1951 Scottish Amateur Film Festival, The Living Ghost (1957), and Glasgow's Docklands (1959). Illness later forced him to give up making films and he spent most of his working life teaching at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow. In 2001 he was the subject of the Channel 4 documentary Artery: the Story of Enrico Cocozza.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/538</guid></item><item><title>MV &amp; EE + support from The Doozer and Cath &amp; Phil Tyler</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/gig/164</link><description>Matt Valentine and Erika Elder combine Indian raga style composition with Appalachian folk and post-psychedelic electrical experimentalism, using Western and Eastern acoustic instruments amplified and augmented with effects.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/gig/164</guid></item><item><title>Reformed Faction + Bruce Gilbert (ex-Wire) + Emergency Librarian</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/gig/181</link><description>Reformed Faction (pioneers of the ambient music genre who have collaborated with some of the most important figures in experimental music and the Krautrock scene),
