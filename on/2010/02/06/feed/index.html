Local luminaries such as Milky Wimpshake and Pale Man Made will be performing covers by the likes of the Brilliant Corners, Shop Assistants, Sea Urchins and Field Mice, as well as tracks from their own fine repertoires, whilst rare archive footage of the period plays in the cinema next door. Lancaster's finest funsters, The Lovely Eggs, round the night off with their unique brand of quiet-loud indiepop. £5 on door (£6 non-members) 8pm-12am</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/164</guid></item><item><title>Other Meeting</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/meeting/46</link><description>Other Meeting</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/meeting/46</guid></item></channel></rss>
