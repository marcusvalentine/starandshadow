The&amp;nbsp;South Yorkshire Refugee Law &amp;amp; Justice Project in Sheffield will lead a workshop on developing a mutual aid based legal support network. We hope to gain a&amp;nbsp;powerful insight into the diverse&amp;nbsp;range of experiences of people living&amp;nbsp;without papers to provide an impetus to develop a similar support network locally.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/1214</guid></item></channel></rss>
