Adapted from Stanislaw Lem’s 1955 novel The Magellanic Cloud, and predating Gene Rodenberry’s Star Trek and Kubrick’s 2001, Ikarie XB-1’s influence can be seen on both - and on almost every other science-fiction vehicle that followed.&amp;nbsp;</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1239</guid></item><item><title>Damaged Goods + Q&amp;A</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1197</link><description>Made entirely in the North East (Broken Scar Productions based in Darlington) using local cast and crew, Damaged Goods is the tale of Carlos, who comes from the brutal world of dog fighting, and is adopted by two kids from a broken home.

(THE GUARDIAN). A crabby old professor goes to collect an award and on his journey reconnects with the lyricism of his youth.&amp;nbsp;</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1244</guid></item><item><title>Leila And The Wolves (1984)</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1201</link><description>As bold politically as it is aesthetically, Leila and the Wolves is a signal work in the history of feminist filmmaking in the Middle East.&amp;nbsp;</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1201</guid></item><item><title>Plein Soleil</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1248</link><description>Celebrating the centenary of Oscar-winning director René Clément, a beautiful newly released restoration of&amp;nbsp;Plein Soleil.&amp;nbsp;This striking study of a glamorous and complex psychopath launched the career of young, beautiful, ultra-cool Alain Delon.

any frame of this film and be looking at a striking still photograph." -
Film Critic Roger Ebert. This film is Bergman's study of a world without love: Karin slides
inexorably into madness, losing her hold on the world, as she is trapped in a
male world of repressed feelings.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1245</guid></item><item><title>No Pasaran</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1228</link><description>Magdeburg is a city in the east of Germany: there is disruption created by an annual parade of fascists claiming to commemorate the casualties of an allied air strike that happened during the Second World War.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1228</guid></item><item><title>La Planète Sauvage (Fantastic Planet, 1973)</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1237</link><description>“A prime piece of evidence in the argument that cinema can effectively 
act as a drug without the need for any external ingestion.”</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1237</guid></item><item><title>Persona   </title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1247</link><description>"I said that Persona
saved my life—that is no exaggeration. If I had not found the strength to make
that film, I would probably have been all washed up" - Bergman. Absolutely
stunning film about how power, jealousy, care and love can all come into play
in one relationship, between a nurse and her patient.&amp;nbsp;</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1247</guid></item><item><title>2013 Film London Jarman Award</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1253</link><description>Screening of film and video work by the 10 artists shortlisted for the 2013 Film London Jarman Award</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1253</guid></item><item><title>Freshers Week Film</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1249</link><description></description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1249</guid></item><item><title>Variety (1983)</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1240</link><description>In Bette Gordon’s pioneering indie narrative about voyeurism from a female perspective, a&amp;nbsp;young woman (Sandy McLeod) works as a ticket taker in a porn theater, and her curiosity&amp;nbsp;leads her to shadow a male patron.
