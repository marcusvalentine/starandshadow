our season of French Film Noir. Rififi is a true classic lauded by
critics and directors alike and credited as archetypal of the 'heist
gone wrong' movie. Mixing the pace and economy of great American
Noirs with European framing and choreography of action. A truly
seminal crime film.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1233</guid></item><item><title>Pauline Murray (Invisible Girls/Storm) &amp; Band + Transfigure + Rachel Lancaster</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/gig/594</link><description>A solo Pauline Murray will be debuting new songs acoustic then joined on stage by her backing band to perform a selection of Invisible Girls/Storm favourites.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/gig/594</guid></item><item><title>Gnaw Festival</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/gig/545</link><description>GNAW fest 3 featuring some of&lt;br&gt;the loudest and most interesting&lt;br&gt;bands in Newcastle including:&lt;br&gt;stoner groovsters Druganaut;&lt;br&gt;improvised noise rockers Waheela;&lt;br&gt;the punishingly loud Tide of Iron;&lt;br&gt;the mighty Knuckle Dragger; and&lt;br&gt;London based avant doomsters&lt;br&gt;Palehorse.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/gig/545</guid></item><item><title>Conversation Group</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/1250</link><description>Weekly conversation session for people to practice speaking English in
