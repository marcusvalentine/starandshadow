Enter the 'Ronin' 
Yojimbo. &amp;nbsp;Cunning and resourceful he sets gang against gang for his own 
amusement and gain. &amp;nbsp;A script that is bleak brutal and cynical, cut 
through with a layer of black humour. &amp;nbsp;Another Kurosawa theme taken up 
and copied in the West, notably by Leone's 'Fistful of Dollars'.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1129</guid></item><item><title>Star And Shadow Book, Music And Film Sale</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/1085</link><description>Books on a range of subjects, as well as CDs, records,
