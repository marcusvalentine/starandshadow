our season of French Film Noir. Rififi is a true classic lauded by
critics and directors alike and credited as archetypal of the 'heist
gone wrong' movie. Mixing the pace and economy of great American
Noirs with European framing and choreography of action. A truly
seminal crime film.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1233</guid></item><item><title>Canny Little Library</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/1247</link><description>Books and magazines, free to browse and borrow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;Come and discover the
