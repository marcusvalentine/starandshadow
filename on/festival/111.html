        <div class="body" itemprop="about" data-fieldname="body" data-bind="htmlValue:body">For the course<p>I am writing this assignment with the dea that the film would be shown
at our cinema in Newcastle – the volunteer run cinema where I work, the Star
and Shadow Cinema.</p>

<p>It is a small cinema with a maximum of 75 seats.</p>

<p>For the review: our programmes are long because we print them every 2
months, so we try to keep the text to about 70 words max for each item. It is
very hard to write something interesting in such few words.</p>

<p>Review</p>

<p>Persepolis</p>
<p>(Animation, 2007, Dir
Marjane Satrapi and Vincent Paronnaud, France)</p>

<p>The Iranian government protested against this film being shown at the
Cannes Film Festival, because it “presented an unrealistic face of the
achievements and results of the glorious Islamic Revolution in some of its
parts." The film still won a the prestigious Jury Prize at the
aforementionned festival. An animated film, written and directed by Iranian
born Marjane Satrapi, it is directly inspired from her youth and tells us what
it is like it be coming of age under the Iranian Revolution.</p>

<div>
<hr />
</div>
<p>If I programmed the film in our cinema, it would have to be after the
film had already been released at the Tyneside cinema in Newcastle. Considering
the interest that the film has attracted, I would think that my main problem
would be that the main audience for this film in Newcastle (university people I
would have thought), would already have seen the film.</p>

<p>Also, we only ever show a film once or twice. This means that showing
the film can be more of an event rather than just a film showing. For all these
reasons, if I showed the film at our cinema I would definitely try to have a
lecturer from university give a talk/ have a discussion about the film
afterwards.</p>
<p>I think that would make the film more interesting and would appeal to
people who maybe had already seen the film, but also people who had not heard
about the film itself. It would also mean that the lecturer involved would talk
about it in his circles, and would in this way promote the film in a way as
well.</p>

<p>For the lecturer, I would have to decide whether to contact a politics
person or a film person. They are not easily available so I would contact both
and see who can make it. However, I think my preference would go toward a
politics/history person, as I think the content of the film is really what
makes it, more than the formal/technical aspects of it.</p>

<p>Our cinema has a capacity of a maximum of 75 seats, and when we have 40
people it is great for us. So if I managed that I would be very happy (for one
of the showings at least).</p>

<p>1.Target audience: eductated older people. </p>
<p>As mentionned earlier, I think University people would be the main
target audience but they would already have seen the film. I would therefore
target them anyway by putting posters up at Uni and sending them emails.</p>
<p>For the politics/history lecturers, I could also suggest that they tell
their students about the film.</p>
<p>But I would try to attract probably educated older people/and younger
educated people as well to a lesser extent by having an event around the film.</p>

<p>2.The story follows a young girl as she comes of age against the
backdrop of the Iranian Revolution, the political situation severely affecting
her life: arrestation and death of members of her family, curtailing of social
liberties, her having to leave her family to go and study abroad.</p>

<p>3.Coming of age under the Iranian Revolution</p>

<p>4.There are many buzz words that could be used. In my case, the review
would have to be very short so there are many of these words that I could not
use.</p>
<p>Ideally, the words I woul try to use are the following: Iranian
revolution; Iranian government; teenager; Metallica; rock music.</p>

<p>5. Other films you would refer to: that is a tough one. For me the film</p>
<p>6.</p>
