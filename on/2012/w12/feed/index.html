The artist follows old uncle Lung Neaw with a 16mm camera during his daily routines. With compassion and humility, we see him walk, talk, eat, pray, cook, hunt, smoke, drink and visit his neighbours. </description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/850</guid></item><item><title>Av Festival 12: Still Life</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/851</link><description>Still Life is set in Fengjie, 150 miles from the Three Gorges Dam, the hydroelectric project on the Yangtze River that submerged thousands of towns and displaced more than a million people. Shot while Fengjie was being demolished, the film has a powerful documentary impact, as two people travel there separately to look for their missing spouses. </description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/851</guid></item><item><title>Av Festival 12: Eternity + Discussion</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/852</link><description>This debut feature won the prestigious Tiger Award at Rotterdam 2011. Evoking the traditional Thai belief that the spirit of the dead returns, Eternity follows a man through three stages of being - as a ghost in his childhood home, as a young man falling in love, and absent in the life of his family in the days following his death.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/852</guid></item><item><title>The Alternative Miss Newcastle Pageant</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/gig/436</link><description>The Alternative Miss Newcastle explodes onto the arts calendar on March 23, with the inaugural pageant taking place at the Star and Shadow Cinema.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/gig/436</guid></item><item><title>AV Festival 12: The Time is Out of Joint: Forest Swords, The Caretaker, Pye Corner Audio</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/gig/420</link><description>Three live performances embrace the concept of Hauntology at the moment we skip an hour to mark the beginning of British Summertime.
