We are doing this through producing a bi-monthly newsreel, made up of a number of videos short enough to use in union and campaign meetings. Reel News is completely independent and non-aligned. We are completely against sectarianism in all its forms, anti-capitalist in outlook, against the anti-trade union laws and in favour of mass collective action in the workplace and on the streets to change society.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/904</guid></item><item><title>Anti Cuts Network</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/781</link><description>Anti Cuts Network Meeting with Reel News</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/781</guid></item></channel></rss>
