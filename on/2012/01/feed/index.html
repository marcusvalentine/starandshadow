We are completely against sectarianism in all its forms, anti-capitalist in outlook, against the anti-trade union laws and in favour of mass collective action in the workplace and on the streets to change society.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/904</guid></item><item><title>Japanese Film Festival 2012: Beyond Anime: The Outer Limits</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/874</link><description>A selection of 17 animation short films from 2002 to 2011.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/874</guid></item><item><title>Japanese Film Festival 2012: KanZeOn + Discussion with the directors!</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/877</link><description>Gorgeous documentary about Japanese Buddhism, or more precisely some of its sounds.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/877</guid></item><item><title>FILM + GIG: DIVINE TRASH presents Journey to the centre of Uranus</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/gig/435</link><description>Divine Trash is going from the outer limits of space to the depths of bad taste as we go BARBARELLA, with Roger Vadim's hymn to young Jane Fonda, set amongst the sexiest of galaxies.
