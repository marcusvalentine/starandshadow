Set in Suriname and shot almost entirely with 16mm steadicam, in thirteen extended ten-minute shots it follows two brothers as they trek from Paramaribo to rainforest villages of the Maroons. Their journey powerfully mirrors that undertaken by their ancestors escape from slavery 300 years earlier. </description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/854</guid></item></channel></rss>
