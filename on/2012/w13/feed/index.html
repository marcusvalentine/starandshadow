Their journey powerfully mirrors that undertaken by their ancestors escape from slavery 300 years earlier. </description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/854</guid></item><item><title>El Topo</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/941</link><description>Jodorowsky is El Topo, the black clad gunslinger and he's looking for trouble.
