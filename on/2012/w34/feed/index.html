&lt;br&gt;Deja vu moments; lost memories, familiar faces and new surroundings.&lt;br&gt;Walk through a dream, a nightmare, a poem, a day: all in the life of someone else.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this four part video installation we hear from four women who all live on the margins in some way.&lt;br&gt;

What happens when our worlds collide, when dreams merge into reality, when we can't see the gaps?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This drama-doc provides a unique platform for rarely heard voices-&lt;br&gt;with an injection of "poetry and mystery".&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
