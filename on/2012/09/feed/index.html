 DARLIN are back! Popklubb is pleased to announce we-re putting on Allo 
Darlin' again at the Star and Shadow Cinema on September the 5th. I'm 
sure anyone who attended their sell out February gig this year will 
vouch for how amazing they were, and well, it's the first time they will
 have played after the release of their album in May, which means you 
can now all sing along… strong support comes from Popklubb faves Pale 
Man Made, and the brooding, rich melodies of locally based The Agency. 
Advance tickets are £8 pound, available here. Given the last gig was sold out, pre-purchase is recommended to avoid disappointment: &lt;a href="http://www.wegottickets.com/event/174758"&gt;&lt;span&gt;http://&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;www.wegottickets.com/event/&lt;/span&gt;174758&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/gig/495</guid></item><item><title>Euros Childs W/ The Wellgreen, Adam Sterne + D Js</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/gig/494</link><description>A Glimpse Of Paradise proudly presents  Euros Childs (National Elf / Wales) Following on from his much loved, sell-out solo piano show at The Lit
