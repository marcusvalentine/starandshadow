We are doing this through producing a bi-monthly newsreel, made up of a number of videos short enough to use in union and campaign meetings. Reel News is completely independent and non-aligned. We are completely against sectarianism in all its forms, anti-capitalist in outlook, against the anti-trade union laws and in favour of mass collective action in the workplace and on the streets to change society.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/904</guid></item><item><title>Japanese Film Festival 2012: Beyond Anime: The Outer Limits</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/874</link><description>A selection of 17 animation short films from 2002 to 2011.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/874</guid></item><item><title>Japanese Film Festival 2012: KanZeOn + Discussion with the directors!</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/877</link><description>Gorgeous documentary about Japanese Buddhism, or more precisely some of its sounds.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/877</guid></item><item><title>ONE-WOMAN-SHOW: Josie Long - The Future is Another Place</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/gig/416</link><description>Josie Long is back again with her fifth solo show.
