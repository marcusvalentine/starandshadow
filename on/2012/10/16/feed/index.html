barrister and award winning author Polly Higgins proposed to the United Nations
that Ecocide be made the fifth Crime Against Peace. There are currently four
Crimes Against Peace: genocide, war crimes, crimes of aggression and crimes
against humanity. Ecocide is the missing fifth crime â€“ it is a crime against
humanity, against current and future generations, and against all life on
Earth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/890</guid></item></channel></rss>
