Allen siezes the opportunity for sumptuous epic cinematography especially in the battle scenes where&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 13px; line-height: 23.390625px; text-indent: 10px;"&gt;Love and Death&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 13px; line-height: 23.390625px; text-indent: 10px;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;makes effective use of its technical qualifications.
