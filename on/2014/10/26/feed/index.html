Plus 4pm - John Barker will be reading from his recently published novel “Futures” .
"It's great. Rollicking, uncompromising stuff. The prose grabs you by the throat and squeezes. The characters are by turns reckless, ambitious, vulnerable and weak. The story is set in the past but couldn't be more relevant. Futures is funny, frightening and very dark." - Ronan Bennett
