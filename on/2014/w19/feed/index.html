After the shooting of a young child, six men, all patrons at Miss G’s Caribbean TakeAway Restaurant, form an ill-fated support group in an attempt to salvage their broken spirits and beseiged community. Set against the backdrop of a multicultural community’s unrealized hopes and dreams, the film is bitter and tragic, funny and hopeful.
