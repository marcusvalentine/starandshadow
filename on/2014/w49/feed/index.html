This will be a "Windmill 
Meeting” for Schumacher North north-east group, which means a 
get-together for discussion.  It will be initiated by watching the DVD of Satish Kumar’s talk given when Schumacher North was 
launched in Leeds.  David Midgley, the Schumacher North organiser will lead the discussion. 
Schumacher North, a regional forum devoted to exploring and promoting the ideas of deep ecology, sustainable development and social transformation pioneered by E.F. Schumacher, author of ‘Small Is Beautiful’.

Schumacher North offers a varied programme of talks, courses, conferences, and practical initiatives, aimed at bringing about the sane, sustainable and compassionate world that Fritz Schumacher and his successors have envisioned.

The cinema has some systems in place which are there to make things easier for everyone and to make the cinema safe. We run inductions to working at the cinema – 2nd Saturday of every month at 11am, and the first Thursday of every month at 6pm (free film screening afterwards for the people who attend the induction) – or you can have your own induction if you come in about an hour before the first shift you do and someone with the know-how will show you the ropes.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/1701</guid></item><item><title>Canny Little Library</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/1709</link><description>Books &amp; magazines, free to browse &amp; borrow.
