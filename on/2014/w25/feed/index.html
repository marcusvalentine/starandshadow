What A Lovely War (1969) </title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1389</link><description>Oh! What a Lovely War redefines the tragedy of World War 1 in bawdy music-hall terms.

hell.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1389</guid></item><item><title>Crossings + Dr Socrates</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/gig/652</link><description>Come TIME TRAVELLING&amp;nbsp;with&amp;nbsp;DOCTOR SOCRATES and
