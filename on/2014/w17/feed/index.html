But recently busted-out no-goodun Emmett Myers has other plans... Taut testosterone-fueled tension in a tin can all the way.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1413</guid></item><item><title>Cancelled - Retrato Peruano Del Perú</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1283</link><description>It is with regret that we have had to cancel the screening of Retrato Peruano Del Perú (unfortunately the film did not come subtitled). We will instead be showing El Inca, la boba y el hijo del ladrón.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1283</guid></item><item><title>El Inca, La Boba Y El Hijo Del Ladrón</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1464</link><description>Filmed
 in the deserted area North of Lima, this film tells the adventures of 
three characters as they leave their town. On their respective journeys, their 
morality, tenacity and integrity are tested, as they defy the stigma of 
their names, trying arduously not to succumb to
 self-fulfilling prophecies. Presented by the Americas Research Group at 
Newcastle University. The 
film will be followed by informal&amp;nbsp;discussion - all are welcome to join.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1464</guid></item><item><title>A Bucket Of Blood (1959)</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1359</link><description>&amp;nbsp;Down-trodden busboy Walter Paisley
(Dick Miller) is desperate to be accepted by the cool beatnik cafe
crowd, he achieves his goal via the accidental stabbing of his
landladies cat but maintaining his position within the pretentious
art community leads to murder in probably the
worlds first black-comedy-horror.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1359</guid></item><item><title>Little Shop Of Horrors (1960)</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1360</link><description>Featuring a catalogue of Corman regulars delivering their best work, particularly Jonathon Haze as anti-hero
florist Seymour Krelboin, Mel Welles as the owner and Dick Miller as a customer who eats the plants, though the real star turn goes to
a psychotically edgy Jack Nicholson as the masochistic undertaker
Wilbur Force. Funny and ridiculous in equal measure, the very
definition of a cult classic.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1360</guid></item><item><title>The Intruder (1962)</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1361</link><description>The
only film which lost him money is also one of Corman's very best.
Tackling topical social issues, this drama was years ahead of it's
time, portraying a white supremacist heading south to stir up racial
conflict. Featuring a youthful William Shatner in his first ever
leading role and probably his best ever screen performance. </description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1361</guid></item><item><title>Sixteen Candles (1984)</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1337</link><description>30 candles for John Hughes' first iconic brat pack movie - first released in May 1984</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1337</guid></item><item><title>Last Woman On Earth/Creature From The Haunted Sea (1960) Double Bill</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1362</link><description>    Still being written on
location by Robert Towne,
the ever
frugal Corman insisted on him also acting, also starring Tony Garbone and Betsy
Jones-Moreland in this under-rated post apocalyptic tropical drama. Followed by a wise-cracking comedy starring the same lead trio and one of cinema's greatest comedy monsters complete
with actual ping-pong eye balls.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1362</guid></item><item><title>Right To Remain Training</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/1430</link><description>Right to Remain Training day</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/1430</guid></item><item><title>Conversation Group</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/1353</link><description>Informal weekly English language conversation practice to meet people
