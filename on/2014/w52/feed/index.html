New Year Circus party.  Circus funk and dance.
Tickets: £12  available in advance:   wegottickets.com

Ring in the New Year with the thrill of the Big Top, the smell of the sawdust, the glitter and glamour
of the aerialists, death defying hoola hoop artists, DJ's clowns and more.  Dance dance dance to drop dead funk from the Carnival of Crows and their travelling show of merry pranksters.   

There will be no other party like this.  The last New Year's Eve on Stepney Bank. Make it one for the Road!  Be there! Dance your socks off!
