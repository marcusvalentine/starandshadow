Malcolm Green: The Mystery of Long Meg
Who made the Long Meg Stone Circle and what it was for, is a mystery. Was it a place of healing, of worship, trading, matchmaking, star-gazing or something else entirely? We shall probably never know, but we can look, measure, speculate and dream. Tonight, storyteller Malcolm Green will tell a story of what might have been.


Pat Renton: The Beltingham Yew
Long long ago, even before your grandmothers time and way farther back still, lived a young yew tree and as the centuries past it put down its roots and watched, standing witness to all life that passed beneath its branches. From ancient rituals to whispered hopes and dreams, all of its ancient being filled with stories.

Archaeologist Paul Frodsham from the North Pennines AONB Partnership will talk about both sites and the storyteller will tell stories about what might have been.

This will be a "Windmill 
Meeting” for Schumacher North north-east group, which means a 
get-together for discussion.  It will be initiated by watching the DVD of Satish Kumar’s talk given when Schumacher North was 
launched in Leeds.  David Midgley, the Schumacher North organiser will lead the discussion. 
Schumacher North, a regional forum devoted to exploring and promoting the ideas of deep ecology, sustainable development and social transformation pioneered by E.F. Schumacher, author of ‘Small Is Beautiful’.

Schumacher North offers a varied programme of talks, courses, conferences, and practical initiatives, aimed at bringing about the sane, sustainable and compassionate world that Fritz Schumacher and his successors have envisioned.
