The cinema has some systems in place which are there to make things easier for everyone and to make the cinema safe. We run inductions to working at the cinema – 2nd Saturday of every month at 11am, and the first Thursday of every month at 6pm (free film screening afterwards for the people who attend the induction) – or you can have your own induction if you come in about an hour before the first shift you do and someone with the know-how will show you the ropes.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/1701</guid></item></channel></rss>
