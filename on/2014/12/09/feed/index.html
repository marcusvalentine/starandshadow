This will be a "Windmill 
Meeting” for Schumacher North north-east group, which means a 
get-together for discussion.  It will be initiated by watching the DVD of Satish Kumar’s talk given when Schumacher North was 
launched in Leeds.  David Midgley, the Schumacher North organiser will lead the discussion. 
Schumacher North, a regional forum devoted to exploring and promoting the ideas of deep ecology, sustainable development and social transformation pioneered by E.F. Schumacher, author of ‘Small Is Beautiful’.

Schumacher North offers a varied programme of talks, courses, conferences, and practical initiatives, aimed at bringing about the sane, sustainable and compassionate world that Fritz Schumacher and his successors have envisioned.
