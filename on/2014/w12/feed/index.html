Technically advanced and beautifully shot by Gordon Willis. Director Woody Allen appears as Zelig in scenes that purport to be vintage newsreel clips of the 1920s and 1930s, but are actually clever recreations, "aged" and scratched-up Citizen Kane-style by special-effects maestros Joel Hynick, Stuart Robinson and R. Greenberg Associates. &amp;nbsp;Worth remembering this appeared a year before Hollywood was wowed by mockumentary This is Spinal Tap. &amp;nbsp;A gem of a film.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1326</guid></item><item><title>Annie Hall</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1323</link><description>'Filled with poignant performances and devastating humor, Annie Hall represents a quantum leap for Woody Allen and remains an American classic.' Rotten Tomatoes.&amp;nbsp;Woody Allen's romantic comedy of the Me Decade follows the up and down relationship of two mismatched New York neurotics. Jewish comedy writer Alvy Singer (Allen) reflects on his past romance with tightly-wound WASP singer Annie Hall (Diane Keaton, née Hall).&amp;nbsp;Funny, wry, tender and fashion-setting Annie Hall beat Star Wars to the Oscar for Best Picture.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; And stay by after the film for a short piano recital by Yoshie Kawamura: after Woody a little musical indulgence with some Chopin....</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1323</guid></item><item><title>Ceylan Hay, Vanity Ward and The Two</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/gig/624</link><description>A chance to hear fantastic talented female folk from Glasgow and Newcastle.

the rallying cry of abolitionists around the world. For those people who
 understand the harm caused by prisons, the concept of dismantling the 
prison-industrial-complex seems like the most logical conclusion. But 
there are still those who cannot imagine a world without prisons. That 
is why, this March, members of the Empty Cages Collective will be travelling the country to host workshops on the prison-industrial-complex
 and prison abolition. </description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/1432</guid></item><item><title>Conversation Group</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/1303</link><description>Informal weekly English language conversation practice to meet people
