Technically advanced and beautifully shot by Gordon Willis. Director Woody Allen appears as Zelig in scenes that purport to be vintage newsreel clips of the 1920s and 1930s, but are actually clever recreations, "aged" and scratched-up Citizen Kane-style by special-effects maestros Joel Hynick, Stuart Robinson and R. Greenberg Associates. &amp;nbsp;Worth remembering this appeared a year before Hollywood was wowed by mockumentary This is Spinal Tap. &amp;nbsp;A gem of a film.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1326</guid></item></channel></rss>
