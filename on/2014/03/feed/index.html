It's not really as pretentious as that with plenty of good sight gags and one-liners. The working out of the&amp;nbsp;parallels with&amp;nbsp;Casablanca&amp;nbsp;are masterly. &amp;nbsp;Unusual in that Allen is here directed by Herbert Ross .&amp;nbsp;</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1324</guid></item><item><title>The Golem And How He Came Into The World (1920) + Live Music: Noize Choir + Wax Magnetic</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1348</link><description>Rabbi Loew brings to life a clay monster to save the Jews&amp;nbsp; in this classic&amp;nbsp; tale set in 16th C Prague</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1348</guid></item><item><title>Love And Death</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1325</link><description>&lt;span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 13px; line-height: 23.390625px; text-indent: 10px;"&gt;In part a homage to all things Russian especially the literature of Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky, in part a reprise of the gags of earlier successful Allen movies. Allen siezes the opportunity for sumptuous epic cinematography especially in the battle scenes where&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 13px; line-height: 23.390625px; text-indent: 10px;"&gt;Love and Death&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 13px; line-height: 23.390625px; text-indent: 10px;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;makes effective use of its technical qualifications.

Technically advanced and beautifully shot by Gordon Willis. Director Woody Allen appears as Zelig in scenes that purport to be vintage newsreel clips of the 1920s and 1930s, but are actually clever recreations, "aged" and scratched-up Citizen Kane-style by special-effects maestros Joel Hynick, Stuart Robinson and R. Greenberg Associates. &amp;nbsp;Worth remembering this appeared a year before Hollywood was wowed by mockumentary This is Spinal Tap. &amp;nbsp;A gem of a film.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1326</guid></item><item><title>Annie Hall</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1323</link><description>'Filled with poignant performances and devastating humor, Annie Hall represents a quantum leap for Woody Allen and remains an American classic.'

Jewish comedy writer Alvy Singer (Allen) reflects on his past romance with tightly-wound WASP singer Annie Hall (Diane Keaton, née Hall).&amp;nbsp;Funny, wry, tender and fashion-setting Annie Hall beat Star Wars to the Oscar for Best Picture.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; And stay by after the film for a short piano recital by Yoshie Kawamura: after Woody a little musical indulgence with some Chopin....</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1323</guid></item><item><title>Ne Refugee Justice Benefit Gig</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/gig/628</link><description>Local bands giving it large for NERJ</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/gig/628</guid></item><item><title>Ian Mcnabb</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/gig/617</link><description>Pindrop Events &amp;amp; Minus Me present a solo acoustic show by Ian McNabb (The Voice and Guitar of The Icicle Works).
