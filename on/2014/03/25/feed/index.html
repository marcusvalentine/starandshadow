the rallying cry of abolitionists around the world. For those people who
 understand the harm caused by prisons, the concept of dismantling the 
prison-industrial-complex seems like the most logical conclusion. But 
there are still those who cannot imagine a world without prisons. That 
is why, this March, members of the Empty Cages Collective will be travelling the country to host workshops on the prison-industrial-complex
 and prison abolition. </description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/1432</guid></item><item><title>Conversation Group</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/1303</link><description>Informal weekly English language conversation practice to meet people
