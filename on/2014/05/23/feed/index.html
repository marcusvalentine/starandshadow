in Ireland by
one time production assistant and
first-time unknown director Coppola with a crew going spare after
wrapping a Formula One movie across the European racing circuit.
This
odd, Hitchcockian, psychological thriller shows some of the promise
later fulfilled in a string of classic films that need no
introduction.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1371</guid></item></channel></rss>
