Yet, percolating under the hot sun and sand are religious 
intolerance, political grand-standing, family woes, and hopefully enough 
love to conquer them all. Presented by the Americas Research Group at Newcastle University. The 
film will be followed by informal&amp;nbsp;discussion - all are welcome to join.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1284</guid></item></channel></rss>
