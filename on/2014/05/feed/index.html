 in the deserted area North of Lima, this film tells the adventures of 
three characters as they leave their town. On their respective journeys, their 
morality, tenacity and integrity are tested, as they defy the stigma of 
their names, trying arduously not to succumb to
 self-fulfilling prophecies. Presented by the Americas Research Group at 
Newcastle University. The 
film will be followed by informal&amp;nbsp;discussion - all are welcome to join.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1464</guid></item><item><title>A Bucket Of Blood (1959)</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1359</link><description>&amp;nbsp;Down-trodden busboy Walter Paisley
(Dick Miller) is desperate to be accepted by the cool beatnik cafe
crowd, he achieves his goal via the accidental stabbing of his
landladies cat but maintaining his position within the pretentious
art community leads to murder in probably the
worlds first black-comedy-horror.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1359</guid></item><item><title>Little Shop Of Horrors (1960)</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1360</link><description>Featuring a catalogue of Corman regulars delivering their best work, particularly Jonathon Haze as anti-hero
florist Seymour Krelboin, Mel Welles as the owner and Dick Miller as a customer who eats the plants, though the real star turn goes to
a psychotically edgy Jack Nicholson as the masochistic undertaker
Wilbur Force. Funny and ridiculous in equal measure, the very
definition of a cult classic.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1360</guid></item><item><title>The Intruder (1962)</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1361</link><description>The
only film which lost him money is also one of Corman's very best.
Tackling topical social issues, this drama was years ahead of it's
time, portraying a white supremacist heading south to stir up racial
conflict. Featuring a youthful William Shatner in his first ever
leading role and probably his best ever screen performance. </description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1361</guid></item><item><title>Sixteen Candles (1984)</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1337</link><description>30 candles for John Hughes' first iconic brat pack movie - first released in May 1984</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1337</guid></item><item><title>Last Woman On Earth/Creature From The Haunted Sea (1960) Double Bill</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1362</link><description>    Still being written on
location by Robert Towne,
the ever
frugal Corman insisted on him also acting, also starring Tony Garbone and Betsy
Jones-Moreland in this under-rated post apocalyptic tropical drama. Followed by a wise-cracking comedy starring the same lead trio and one of cinema's greatest comedy monsters complete
with actual ping-pong eye balls.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1362</guid></item><item><title>Psi-Fu Dunt (2014) + Roger Corman Bonus Feature</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1363</link><description>WEEKENDER/EXpac "film in a weekend" premiere.

Yet, percolating under the hot sun and sand are religious 
intolerance, political grand-standing, family woes, and hopefully enough 
love to conquer them all. Presented by the Americas Research Group at Newcastle University. The 
film will be followed by informal&amp;nbsp;discussion - all are welcome to join.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1284</guid></item><item><title>May 11 Elektro Moskva [2013]+ Free Jam_#4 Looking East Season</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1293</link><description>Electro Moscow is an essayistic documentary about the Soviet electronic age and its legacy. The story begins with the inventor of the world’s first electronic instrument, Leon Theremin, unveiling the KGB’s huge pile of fascinating devices, some of which were musical.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1293</guid></item><item><title>The Blood Of A Poet (1930)</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1349</link><description>Opening our season from this masterly director. An entry point into
Cocteau's personal and poetic imagery. This experimental film was
made the same year (1930) as Buñuel's L'Age d'or.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1349</guid></item><item><title>A Winter Tale</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1285</link><description>

After the shooting of a young child, six men, all patrons at Miss G’s Caribbean TakeAway Restaurant, form an ill-fated support group in an attempt to salvage their broken spirits and beseiged community. Set against the backdrop of a multicultural community’s unrealized hopes and dreams, the film is bitter and tragic, funny and hopeful.

the film deals with the prejudice against the Mexican-American workers, 
who struck to attain wage parity with Anglo workers in other mines and 
to be treated with dignity by the bosses.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1339</guid></item><item><title>Living On The Edge: Short Films On Migration And Welfare Reform In The Uk </title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1384</link><description>Short films about the 
effects of recent welfare and migration
 reform on the lives of asylum seekers and benefit claimants in the UK. 
These films present the lived experiences of people struggling to
