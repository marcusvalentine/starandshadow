It is tender and&amp;nbsp;unsentimental&amp;nbsp;and a testament to the persistence of the human&amp;nbsp;spirit.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1400</guid></item><item><title>Lalie Polne (The Lilies of the Field)</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1392</link><description></description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/1392</guid></item><item><title>Hannabiell &amp; Yilis Present:  Cartoon Mania: 4th Annul Fancy Dress Party</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/gig/642</link><description>Hannabiell &amp; Yilis Present:

Plus 4pm - John Barker will be reading from his recently published novel “Futures” .
"It's great. Rollicking, uncompromising stuff. The prose grabs you by the throat and squeezes. The characters are by turns reckless, ambitious, vulnerable and weak. The story is set in the past but couldn't be more relevant. Futures is funny, frightening and very dark." - Ronan Bennett
