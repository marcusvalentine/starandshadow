a new, fast-paced cinematic journey through the
wild world of climate change: the science, the 
politics, the solutions, and the stories that define 
this crisis at this pivotal point in human history.
The movie is about an hour long, and after we 
watch it we’ll have a discussion about what we 
can all do together on this important issue.
