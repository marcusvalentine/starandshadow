Surreal and at times absurd, Woman of the Dunes has been compared to existentialist works such as Sartre's No Exit and Beckett's Happy Days. A man trapped in a mysterious seaside town, a woman confined to a hole in the ground, and the ever shifting sand, which almost becomes a character in its own right.

Naked Lunch is one of the most influential books of the 20th century. It was first published in 1959 and is written by William S. Burroughs. His style and areas of interest were unique at the time and there are still few who could claim to match him for his sheer originality and ability to express the individuals and groups that exist out of sight of the mainstream. So, we plan to raise some ghosts and improvise some incantations, this may involve some serious inebriation with whatever poison gets you there. Bring any copy of a Burroughs book and will get someone who isn't old Bill to sign it for you. Watch out for the cars. Mark.
