The sole rule is that everyone discusses as if a performance had just taken place - that the performers performed it and the audience watched it.  A meeting between a club, performance, and a game.  All welcome! </description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/188</guid></item></channel></rss>
