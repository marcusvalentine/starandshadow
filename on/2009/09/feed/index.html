Nina is an animator whose husband moves to India, then dumps her by email. Three hilarious shadow puppets narrate both ancient tragedy and modern comedy in this beautifully animated interpretation of the Indian epic Ramayana, scored with 1920's jazz. 

Director Nina Paley has taken the unusual step of making Sita Sings The Blues available to everyone under a Creative Commons License so the film will be beamed to our plush auditorium direct from the internet.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/416</guid></item><item><title>An American In Paris</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/390</link><description>We push on through to the fifties with this Gene Kelly / Vincente Minnelli classic. The story of ex-G.I. Jerry's (Gene Kelly) sojourn in Paris, this has everything you could ask for in a musical. Gems such as 'I Got Rhythm', Embraceable You and Nice Work If You Can Get It, glorious Technicolor (as ever) and an 18 minute long mini-ballet. Quite possibly why celluloid was dreamt up.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/390</guid></item><item><title>In Transition</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/483</link><description>The Premiere of the new documentary charting the spread of the inspiring Transition Movement; could this be our best chance yet of surviving climate change and peak oil?</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/483</guid></item><item><title>Les Silences du Palais (TUNISIA)</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/418</link><description>Stunningly acted, beautifully shot.
