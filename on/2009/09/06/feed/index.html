The story of ex-G.I. Jerry's (Gene Kelly) sojourn in Paris, this has everything you could ask for in a musical. Gems such as 'I Got Rhythm', Embraceable You and Nice Work If You Can Get It, glorious Technicolor (as ever) and an 18 minute long mini-ballet. Quite possibly why celluloid was dreamt up.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/390</guid></item><item><title>Make and Mend Market</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/146</link><description>An indy craft, art and flea market offering goodies from new designers alongside
