Nina is an animator whose husband moves to India, then dumps her by email. Three hilarious shadow puppets narrate both ancient tragedy and modern comedy in this beautifully animated interpretation of the Indian epic Ramayana, scored with 1920's jazz. 

Director Nina Paley has taken the unusual step of making Sita Sings The Blues available to everyone under a Creative Commons License so the film will be beamed to our plush auditorium direct from the internet.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/416</guid></item><item><title>Volunteer Induction</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/107</link><description>Volunteer Induction - participants welcome to stay for this evening's film</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/107</guid></item></channel></rss>
