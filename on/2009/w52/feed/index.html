A Bit Crack's popular Open Nights are for anyone who wants to share a yarn, tell a story, or just enjoy listening to others tell theirs. This is your chance to bring a story to tell or a song to sing to welcome in the New Year - supported by our hosts and encouraged by you, the audience. Open Nights are always fun and full of surprises so join us as a teller or listener.
