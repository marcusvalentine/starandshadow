The Star and Shadow will open at 9pm for those who wish to move up the hill before the Scrapping has finished, and for those who would like to come along for a drink before the party starts.
“When the klaxon sounds - obliterate everything in sight!” 

Have you ever sat in front of a computer and wanted to smash it up? Or a TV, or a cooker, or a car, or a chair...? Scrap Club gives you the chance to do just that!
