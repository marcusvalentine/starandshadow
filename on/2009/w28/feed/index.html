David Cronenberg)</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/447</link><description>Oliver Reed (!!) stars as an unconventional therapist who encourages Samantha Eggar to undergo “psychoplasmic” therapy – whereby mental and emotional trauma takes physical form – and produces scores of deformed, murderous children who prey upon her young (human) daughter. Made after a difficult custody battle between Cronenberg and his former wife, The Brood is perhaps the director’s most cathartic and autobiographical film.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/447</guid></item><item><title>Special People</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/452</link><description></description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/452</guid></item><item><title>UKELEAR MELTDOWN: The Movie</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/485</link><description>Featuring the Dulwich Ukulele Club, Molly and Me, Eilidh Macaskill, Cat Green Bike and Staggerin' Jon Lee, UKELEAR MELTDOWN: The Movie looks at the phenomenal success of the second national festival of extreme Ukulele and the big personalities with small instruments.

Released around the same time as The Matrix, the movie appeared as the smarter, scrappier arthouse cousin to the self-important blockbuster.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/448</guid></item><item><title>Narcfest</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/gig/129</link><description>Alternative music stage as part of Narcfest.
