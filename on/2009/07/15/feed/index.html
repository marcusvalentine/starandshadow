David Cronenberg)</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/447</link><description>Oliver Reed (!!) stars as an unconventional therapist who encourages Samantha Eggar to undergo “psychoplasmic” therapy – whereby mental and emotional trauma takes physical form – and produces scores of deformed, murderous children who prey upon her young (human) daughter.
