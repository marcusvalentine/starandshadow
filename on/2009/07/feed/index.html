David Cronenberg)</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/447</link><description>Oliver Reed (!!) stars as an unconventional therapist who encourages Samantha Eggar to undergo “psychoplasmic” therapy – whereby mental and emotional trauma takes physical form – and produces scores of deformed, murderous children who prey upon her young (human) daughter.

Released around the same time as The Matrix, the movie appeared as the smarter, scrappier arthouse cousin to the self-important blockbuster.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/448</guid></item><item><title>Mudhoney</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/453</link><description>In the first of our series of films from Meyer's Southern Gothic era, an odd job man gets involved with his employer's wife.
