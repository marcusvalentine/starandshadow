Narrative is at the centre of much of his work, whether deconstructing it as in Scratch, or creating humorous and absurd situations to find existential meaning in the margins of modern life. We are very fortunate to have George Barber in person, in conversation with the programme's curator Matthew Noel-Tod.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/366</guid></item><item><title>Show Boat</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/382</link><description>Sing-a-long-a-Sunday!
