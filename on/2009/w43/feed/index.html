Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew meets Cole Porter in this play within a musical within a film. Originally filmed in 3D - expect a surfeit of objects thrown at the camera as well as classic ditties 'So In Love', 'Too Darn Hot' and (in canny preparation for next week's festival of the same name!) 'Wunderbar'. Keep your eyes peeled for the Bob Fosse cameo.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/film/409</guid></item><item><title>Martins night - *****HATE </title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/gig/142</link><description>“…in our timidity let each make a choice; whether to remain consciously a servant of falsehood…”</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/gig/142</guid></item><item><title>*CANCELLED* Trad Gras Och Stenar</title><link>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/163</link><description>Unfortunately the Swedes' tour has fallen through meaning this date has been cancelled.

Everyone is welcome to join in, but all we ask is that you bring your own pumpkin and sharp knife.  Adults are kindly asked to leave their pumpkins in the cinema to help decorate for the night, but kids can take their pumpkins home.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/178</guid></item></channel></rss>
