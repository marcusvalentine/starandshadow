On the 1st of May, Breeze Creatives will be hosting a free event at the BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art to introduce and showcase London based charity Arts Emergency. Co-founded and ran by Josie Long and Neil Griffiths the charity is dedicated to helping disadvantaged people gain access to arts education through a mentorship program. They believe that each person who has been fortunate to have been helped along their artistic career should give back. Whether it is through the mentor system, or by donation to the charity.

 The increasing divide between rich and poor alongside the rise in University fees, changes the way people view their prospectus degrees. Being tempted to play safe and opt for a more work-related degree or more ‘useful’ job jeopardises the future of the humanities, leading towards nationwide mergers and closures.

“Arts Emergency are highlighting the reversal of decades’ of social access to the arts, and by association the possible disappearance of whole strands of discourse and the loss of educational enfranchisement to future generations. Save the thinker!” Stewart Lee

 Breeze Creatives are dedicated to working alongside this organisation, which based in London struggles to have much ‘feet on the floor’ action in the North East. Which is why we are dedicated to raising money for them alongside a free office space in central Newcastle, so that mentors can come and meet students and work from there. The inspiring work that this charity undertakes can be seen on their website so please take the time to check at http://www.arts-emergency.org/

 We would like to invite you to take part in an event that we are showcasing on May 1st at the BALTIC. The event itself will be a sister event to those taking part on the South Bank for the promotion of Arts Emergency. We have decided to support the amazing work that Arts Emergency is doing in recruiting mentors from the most diverse range of artistic practices in order to support young people from the most disadvantaged backgrounds enter into the arts. Breeze Creatives and Arts Emergency are wishing to gather mentors in all areas, dance, performance, theatre, creative writing etc.

 Participating organisations include ¡VAMOS!, ZENDEH, Dance City, Candy Vortex, NOVAK, Star &amp; Shadow Cinema, more to be announced soon. And music from Richard Dawson and Shields.
