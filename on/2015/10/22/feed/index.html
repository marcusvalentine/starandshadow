It is hard work. It is ladder holding mostly, maybe one other to climb with him but 6 are needed to support the job, There is also pallet loading. Easy- there is a manual pallet lifter.

More volunteers in general are needed on Thursday nights and Saturday afternoons to help deconstruct and pack. Dan and Steven Turner cannot do this work on their own. Another dozen are needed.</description><guid>https://www.starandshadow.org.uk/on/event/1771</guid></item></channel></rss>
