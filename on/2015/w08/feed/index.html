DESIGN A WAVE

(Alien Jams / No Label / Alter Records / London)

Named after a street gang in the Troma film Surf Nazis Must Die, Design A Wave is the sensational solo output of London based synth mutant Tom Hirst (trying saying that with a lisp) who takes to the tough, urban street roads of the Great Satan in light of a tasty new 12" on Alien Jams, following last year's excellent double whammy disco slab on No Label imprint. Mega!
