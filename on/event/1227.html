        <div class="body" itemprop="about" data-fieldname="body" data-bind="htmlValue:body"><h2>LINE-UP</h2><div><p><strong>11am – wristbands available from box office</strong></p><p><strong>11.30am – doors open</strong></p><p><strong>12pm - </strong><strong>RICHARD DAWSON WELCOMES YOU TO TUSK MINI</strong></p><p>Dawson’s set last October was equal parts lethal singing/playing and his side-splittingly surreal between-song digressions. AT TUSK Mini, Richard is your personal Master Of Ceremonies and will guide you aboard the esoteric rollercoaster of today’s programme</p><p><strong>12.15pm - </strong><strong>DESMADRADOS SOLDADOS DE VENTURA</strong></p><p>An 18-legged psych monster hovering lysergically in formation over your altered mental state, DSDV feature an elite coterie of Mancunian leftfiled luminaries and create a blissful, wailing psychedelic big band experience.</p><p>As The Wire described them recently, they deliver “the kind of trance-inducing constructs that short-circuit thought while touching on the desperate ascension style of Albert Ayler’s New York Eye &amp; Ear Control Group, complete with that same weeping, testifying tone with heavenly vibrato traded for endless wah-wah.</p><p><strong>1pm - </strong><strong>THE WIRE TALKS TO RICHARD PINHAS</strong></p><p>Richard Pinhas has greatly influenced the development of European experimental music across four decades, sublimely fusing electronic and rock music with his revered band Heldon and through a solo career still blazing today, as recent collaborations with Oren Ambarchi, Tatsuya Yoshida, Wolf Eyes and others evidence.</p><p>Richard also studied under Deleuze, lived through the ’68 uprising, interviewed Philip K Dick and much more, so there’ll be no shortage of subject matter.</p><p>Talking to Richard Pinhas is the writer David Keenan. Well known to the TUSK audience as a regular contributor to The Wire, he has been published in a wide range of music publications and in recent years has increasingly focused on his own fiction. David is also a co-proprietor of Glasgow’s Volcanic Tongue record shop.</p><p><strong>2pm - </strong><strong>FILM PROGRAMME</strong></p><p>Another heady afternoon cocktail presented by Has Gaylani and Joe Murray and with a jaw-dropping line-up of Caroliner, Sun Ra, Art Ensemble Of Chicago, Sun City Girls, Malcy Duff and the most intense gamelan performance imaginable. 2 hours of intense cinematic genius in the Cinema space – limited seating, squeeze in where you can and sink into the screen. Full details<a href="http://tuskfestival.com/artists/film-programme/"> here</a></p><p><strong>3pm/4pm/5pm - </strong><strong>BONGOLEEROS</strong></p><p><span>3 intimate shows in confined spaces for a limited number of TUSK Mini ticket holders, only 10 per session – contact us to grab yours now</span></p><p><strong>6pm - </strong><strong>RICHARD DAWSON INTRODUCES THE EVENING LINE-UP</strong></p><p>Mr Dawson returns to the stage to present the evening’s live programme.</p><p><strong>6.15pm - </strong><strong>POPULAR RADIATION</strong></p><p>Hasan Gaylani has honed his deft approach to tape abuse and classic drone manoeuvres with a series of recordings that are maybe the closest we’ll ever get to the sound of Moondog and early Terry Riley collaborating on a release for Hospital Productions.</p><p>As Radio Free Midwich put it, “My thoughts drift in and out of focus as these pieces progress, becoming more or less plausible. To attempt to think hard about Popular Radiation is to put yourself in the position of the little girl in the film Poltergeist: her hand on the television screen, face flush to the static, chatting with voices only she can hear…”</p><p><strong>7.15pm - </strong><strong>ANNIHILATING LIGHT</strong></p><p>The potentially lethal cocktail of Stefan Jaworzyn and Heather Leigh. Jaworzyn, founder member of Skullflower, briefly part of Whitehouse, driving force behind Ascension and Descension and suddenly poking at the public ear again with a raft of new and re-discovered records released recently that veer across everything from his trademark guitar excruciations to pounding synth&amp;noise workouts. Heather Leigh is the coalminer’s daughter from Texas with the killer voice/pedal steel combination that’s graced recordings as part of Charalambides, Scorces, Dream/Aktion Unit, Jailbreak, Jandek and her own solo recordings. Taking their name from Jaworzyn’s recent LP on Kye, this is only the duo’s second show together.</p><p><strong>8.30pm - </strong><strong>LUMISOKEA</strong></p><p>The rich, dark, bass heavy sound of Lumisokea draws a dark, foreboding aura from an abundance of reference points – codifying and making concrete connections in the worlds of noise, dub, techno and musique concrète, and with heavy, machine-led influence of traditional Asian &amp; African percussion musics. Reviewers speak of “Dark cinematic atmosphere (De:bug) and “Arresting sound design” (Sonic Router) – we’re excited to hear their glacial textures, fractured rhythms and throbbing low end live.</p><p><strong>10pm - </strong><strong>RICHARD PINHAS</strong></p><p>Using little more than guitar and effects rack, Richard Pinhas is our guide into outer space. Emerging from deep in the French political underground of the late 1960s to form Heldon in the early part of the following decade, Pinhas was the prime motivator of Heldon and created a formidable body of work that is still only now garnering the recognition it deserves. Pinhas’ creativity has continued beyond Heldon’s late 70s dwindling, still adding to his sizeable discography, often alongside such notable collaborators as Oren Ambarchi, Lasse Marhaug, Wolf Eyes and Merzbow; this year alone he’s released albums with Ambarchi and also Tatsuya Yoshida of the great Ruins.</p><p><strong>11.15pm - </strong><strong>TORTURING NURSE</strong></p><p>Most people in Shanghai can’t take the kind of noise that we make. To be honest, most people can barely accept things that are anti-rhythm and anti-melody, let alone the kind of violence that is contained in the noise we make. We don’t perform with the intention of shocking people, we just like doing this stuff – but most people can’t take it.’</p><p>We’re excited to bring you this deafening glimpse into the Chinese underground, a musical world still relatively unknown to us in the UK. It’s already evident that TUSK audiences react most excitedly to eviscerating Asian sonic brutalism and no doubt you’ll all stagger away from this with delirious grins on your melted faces.</p><p><strong>12am - </strong><strong>NO BALLS</strong></p><p>Furious despondency seems like a contradiction but that’s the feeling we get from listening to No Balls, the musical equivalent of repeatedly whacking your head into a stud wall. Its music that could be described as “dumb” or “brainless” and the same has been said of The Stooges, but like the Ann Arbor deities, No Balls navigate a route-one course direct to the very essence of what it is about raucous guitars and drums that can (in the right hands) make you feel you should throw yourself around a room. Simple, direct, unrefined and with absolutely maximal raw power.</p></div><h2></h2><h2><span>TICKETS INFO</span></h2><p>Tickets are £15 and are available from this site using Paypal and via wegottickets.com</p><p>An Enhanced TUSK Mini ticket is also available from this site that includes a copy of the vinyl album AMBARCHI/CAMPBELL/FLOWER ‘Live at TUSK Festival 2013′.</p><p><strong>Doors open</strong> at 11am on Saturday 12th July.
