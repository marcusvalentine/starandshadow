<h2><strong>ABOUT</strong></h2>
</div>
<p> The new CALF label was created in 2010 by Nobuaki Doi, with the aim of making available work from independent Japanese filmmakers, whose films would not be seen otherwise. Their work is different from the “anime” style, which is the Japanese style of animation that is generally known, and in which the manga style can be included.</p>
<p>The films shown today are coming from 3 directors and one filmmaking collective, and their style is incredibly innovative and varied.</p>
<p>The <strong>TOCHKA collective</strong> is made of Nagata Takeshi and Monno Kazue, and they have invented a new animation technique called PiKA PiKA, which is the combination of long exposure and stop motion animation technique. It enables everyone to make animation with drawings by penlights in the air.</p>
<p><strong><img height="200" src="/static/img/import/tochka-lights.jpg?origsrc=http://flux.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/tochka-lights.jpg" width="300" />Kei Oyama’s</strong> style is very original: he uses a collage of photographs shot in close-up. His film Consultation Room (2005, photo on this page) was shown in the Directors' Fortnight in Cannes and won the Honorary Mentions in Ars Electronica. HAND SOAP (2008, photo on the first page of the press release) was awarded the Excellence Prizes in International Festival for Arts and Media Yokohama and the Prize of the International Short FIlm Festival in Oberhausen.</p>
<p> <strong>Atsushi Wada</strong> makes incredibly beautiful and poetic hand-drawn animation, with very fine lines, and his work is also noticeable for his use of whispering sounds. A strange and absurd world full of humor and sadness.</p>
<p> <strong>Mirai Mizue’s</strong> style could be compared to hand-drawn visual symphonics. His drawings are based on the image of cells, and his films are non-narrative.</p>

He is known by his affection towards cells in his non-narrative animation films. His films have been nominated in some major animation festivals like Annecy, Zagreb, Ottawa and Hiroshima. DEVOUR DINNER won the Second Prize in Animadrid. In SICAF he made a commissioned film from the festival in 2009 and was a member of Selection Committees in 2010. As an illustrator, he provides his drawings to some Japanese novelists. He is also a member of Japan Animation Association and a teacher in O-HARA school. </p>
<p><strong>TOCHKA</strong> is a creative unit that acts by Nagata Takeshi and Monno Kazue. They invented new method of making animation called PiKA PiKA, which is the combination of long exposure and stop motion animation technique. It enables everyone to make animation with drawings by penlights in the air. Their playing field is very wide from experimental animations to illustrations. PiKA PiKA was nominated in Annecy and won some awards including the Honourable Mention in Ottawa, the Excellence Award in Japan Media Arts Festival and the Grand Prix in Clermont-Ferrand.  </p>

He likes to make comfortable movements and is always thinking about the Japanese traditional concept called "Ma", the tension produced between movements.
