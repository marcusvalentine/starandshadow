share information on inspirational campaigns and struggles – not just in
 this country, but across the world. We are doing this through producing
 a bi-monthly newsreel, made up of a number of videos short enough to 
use in union and campaign meetings.

Reel News will try and cover it all, from pensioners protesting 
against cuts in voluntary services, artists and musicians looking at the
 world in a different way, through strikes against privatisation, right 
up to the astonishing social movements in Latin America which have 
brought down governments through uprisings, mass direct action and 
general strikes.

Reel News is intended as a two-way resource, so let us know about 
your campaigns. Better still, film them yourself and send us the video. 
We can also be commissioned to make campaign videos, and offer help on 
camerawork, video editing and other skills needed to make your own 
video.

Reel News is completely independent and non-aligned. We are 
completely against sectarianism in all its forms, anti-capitalist in 
outlook, against the anti-trade union laws and in favour of mass 
collective action in the workplace and on the streets to change society.</p><p>http://www.facebook.com/events/333652176703792/</p><div><h3 class="h3">

<div><strong>Greece Films released online from Friday</strong>
 Here's something we'd like some feedback on. Seeing as Greece has been 
turned into a big neoliberal experiment to test how far workers wages 
and conditions can be destroyed before applying it to the rest of us in 
Europe, we're going to try a little experiment of our own.

We know that in the run up to the Greek elections and beyond, the mainstream media will be full of lies in order to justify thi<span class="ecxtext_exposed_show">s
 experiment. So we are going to try and redress the balance a bit by 
releasing all the films we've made online, one a week at the same time 
for the next 6 weeks. Maybe we can't compete with the likes of bbc and 
sky, but maybe we can build up an audience that will go out and do 
something with the information…

So at the moment we're thinking every Friday at Midday, (2pm Greece 
time) starting this Friday June 1. What do you all think out there? 
Comments please! And please tell us which film you'd like to see first.</span> </div>
<div><img alt="" height="106" src="/static/img/import/potatoweb.jpg?origsrc=http://gallery.mailchimp.com/67b31131388e3f876faa35fbb/images/potatoweb.jpg" width="160" /></div>
<div>By the way, if you've been meaning to fill out that <strong>standing order form</strong> and post it back to us but haven't got round to it, we've just made it a lot easier for you. <strong>You can now take out a standing order on Paypal.</strong> It'll take you less than a minute, just click <a href="http://reelnews.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=67b31131388e3f876faa35fbb&amp;id=22f4930e92&amp;e=0ef773e822">here</a>.
We rely for our funding on <a href="http://reelnews.us2.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=67b31131388e3f876faa35fbb&amp;id=595c4b33b8&amp;e=0ef773e822">DVD sales, subscriptions and donations</a>.
 This allows us to maintain our independence and reflect the concerns of
 the ordinary worker. Although we are growing steadily, we still 
struggle to meet running costs, and can’t afford to pay ourselves more 
than expenses as yet. So as well as the basic £3 per month subscription,
 you'll find options to pay more every month if you can afford to, up to
 £20 per month.

<div>More and more <strong>trade union branches and trades councils</strong>
 are subscribing; again if you can pass a motion to subscribe at yours, 
that will really help us out too. To subscribe for 1 year (6 issues), 
send a cheque for £50 payable to Reel News to the address at the bottom 
of this letter; any additional donation you’d like to make would be very
 gratefully received. Individuals can subscribe for £30 a year, or take 
out a standing order for £3 minimum a month. You can download the 
standing order form <a href="http://reelnews.us2.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=67b31131388e3f876faa35fbb&amp;id=3d8b891204&amp;e=0ef773e822">here</a>.

<strong>If you haven't heard about us before:</strong>
	 
	Reel News is an activist video collective that has been in existence 
since 2006. It was set up to publicise and share information on 
inspirational campaigns and struggles – not just in this country, but 
across the world.
	 
	We:
	1)    Produce a bi-monthly 100-minute newsreel, made up of a number of 
films short enough to use in union and campaign meetings.
	2)    Post videos and slideshows of current struggles online every week at our website, <a>reelnews.co.uk</a>
	3)    Organise screenings around the country with the aim of bringing 
people together to discuss collectively the issues raised in the films, 
and then hopefully agree on some form of action.
	 
	Reel News has made films covering and publicising a number of campaigns
 and strikes over the past five years. We were the only people to film 
the historic victory by electricians recently, as they stopped Balfour 
Beatty and 7 other major companies cutting their wages by 35% and 
tearing up national agreements. We worked with the rank and file sparks 
committee to produce constant video updates to spread the action and get
 information out.
	 
	We’ve made films on the pensions dispute, the fight to save the NHS, 
the student struggles of 2010, struggles against the cuts, factory 
occupations including Visteon and Vestas, the campaign against the 
blacklist and strikes across the public sector, as well as international
 trade union struggles, environmental struggles, Palestine solidarity, 
anti-war campaigns and community campaigns. To see the films visit the 
website at <a>reelnews.co.uk</a>.
	 
	We can be commissioned to make campaign films, or to teach people the 
skills they need to make short films themselves. Price is negotiable – 
down to nothing if your branch is penniless or on strike!</div></div>

                    <p>REEL NEWS is an activist video collective, set up to publicise and share information on inspirational campaigns and struggles - not just in this country, but across the world. We are doing this through producing a bi-monthly newsreel, made up of a number of videos short enough to use in union and campaign meetings. Reel News is completely independent and non-aligned. We are completely against sectarianism in all its forms, anti-capitalist in outlook, against the anti-trade union laws and in favour of mass collective action in the workplace and on the streets to change society.</p>
